Welcome, good Marcellus.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nWhat, has this thing appear’d again tonight?\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\nI have seen nothing.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nHoratio says ’tis but our fantasy,\\nAnd will not let belief take hold of him\\nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.\\nTherefore I have entreated him along\\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night,\\nThat if again this apparition come\\nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nTush, tush, ’twill not appear.\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\nSit down awhile,\\nAnd let us once again assail your ears,\\nThat are so fortified against our story,\\nWhat we two nights have seen.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWell, sit we down,\\nAnd let us hear Barnardo speak of this.\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\nLast night of all,\\nWhen yond same star that’s westward from the pole,\\nHad made his course t’illume that part of heaven\\nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,\\nThe bell then beating one—\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nPeace, break thee off.

I charge thee speak!\\n\\n[_Exit Ghost._]\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\n’Tis gone, and will not answer.\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\nHow now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.\\nIs not this something more than fantasy?\\nWhat think you on’t?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nBefore my God, I might not this believe\\nWithout the sensible and true avouch\\nOf mine own eyes.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nIs it not like the King?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nAs thou art to thyself:\\nSuch was the very armour he had on\\nWhen he th’ambitious Norway combated;\\nSo frown’d he once, when in an angry parle\\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\\n’Tis strange.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\\nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIn what particular thought to work I know not;\\nBut in the gross and scope of my opinion,\\nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\\nWhy this same strict and most observant watch\\nSo nightly toils the subject of the land,\\nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon\\nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\\nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.\\nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste\\nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:\\nWho is’t that can inform me?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nThat can I;\\nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,\\nWhose image even but now appear’d to us,\\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\\nThereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,\\nDar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,\\nFor so this side of our known world esteem’d him,\\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,\\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\\nWhich he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;\\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\\nWas gaged by our King; which had return’d\\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\\nHad he been vanquisher; as by the same cov’nant\\nAnd carriage of the article design’d,\\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\\nOf unimproved mettle, hot and full,\\nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,\\nShark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,\\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\\nThat hath a stomach in’t; which is no other,\\nAs it doth well appear unto our state,\\nBut to recover of us by strong hand\\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\\nSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,\\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\\nOf this post-haste and rummage in the land.\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\nI think it be no other but e’en so:\\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\\nComes armed through our watch so like the King\\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nA mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.\\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\\nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\\nUpon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands,\\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.\\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\\n\\nRe-enter Ghost.\\n\\nBut, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!\\nI’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!\\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\\nSpeak to me.\\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\\nThat may to thee do ease, and grace to me,\\nSpeak to me.\\nIf thou art privy to thy country’s fate,\\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid,\\nO speak!\\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\\nSpeak of it. Stay, and speak!\\n\\n[_The cock crows._]\\n\\nStop it, Marcellus!\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nDo, if it will not stand.\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\n’Tis here!\\n\\nHORATIO.\\n’Tis here!\\n\\n[_Exit Ghost._]\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\n’Tis gone!\\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\\nTo offer it the show of violence,\\nFor it is as the air, invulnerable,\\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\\n\\nBARNARDO.\\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nAnd then it started, like a guilty thing\\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\\nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\\nTh’extravagant and erring spirit hies\\nTo his confine. And of the truth herein\\nThis present object made probation.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\\nSome say that ever ’gainst that season comes\\nWherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,\\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long;\\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,\\nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;\\nSo hallow’d and so gracious is the time.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nSo have I heard, and do in part believe it.\\nBut look, the morn in russet mantle clad,\\nWalks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\\nBreak we our watch up, and by my advice,\\nLet us impart what we have seen tonight\\nUnto young Hamlet; for upon my life,\\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nLet’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know\\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.\\n\\nEnter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,\\nLaertes, Voltemand,\\nCornelius, Lords and Attendant.\\n\\nKING.\\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death\\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe;\\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,\\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\\nTh’imperial jointress to this warlike state,\\nHave we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,\\nWith one auspicious and one dropping eye,\\nWith mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,\\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole,\\nTaken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d\\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\\nNow follows, that you know young Fortinbras,\\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth,\\nOr thinking by our late dear brother’s death\\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\\nHe hath not fail’d to pester us with message,\\nImporting the surrender of those lands\\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\\nTo our most valiant brother. So much for him.\\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting:\\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,\\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\\nOf this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress\\nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,\\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\\nOut of his subject: and we here dispatch\\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,\\nGiving to you no further personal power\\nTo business with the King, more than the scope\\nOf these dilated articles allow.\\nFarewell; and let your haste commend your duty.\\n\\nCORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.\\nIn that, and all things, will we show our duty.\\n\\nKING.\\nWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.\\n\\n[_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]\\n\\nAnd now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?\\nYou told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes?\\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\\nAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nDread my lord,\\nYour leave and favour to return to France,\\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark\\nTo show my duty in your coronation;\\nYet now I must confess, that duty done,\\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,\\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\\n\\nKING.\\nHave you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\\nBy laboursome petition; and at last\\nUpon his will I seal’d my hard consent.\\nI do beseech you give him leave to go.\\n\\nKING.\\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!\\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n[_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.\\n\\nKING.\\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNot so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust.\\nThou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die,\\nPassing through nature to eternity.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, madam, it is common.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nIf it be,\\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSeems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.\\n’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\\nNor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,\\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\\nNor the dejected haviour of the visage,\\nTogether with all forms, moods, shows of grief,\\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed seem,\\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\\n\\nKING.\\n’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\\nTo give these mourning duties to your father;\\nBut you must know, your father lost a father,\\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\\nIn filial obligation, for some term\\nTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere\\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\\nOf impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief,\\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\\nAn understanding simple and unschool’d;\\nFor what we know must be, and is as common\\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\\nTake it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,\\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\\nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme\\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\\nFrom the first corse till he that died today,\\n‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth\\nThis unprevailing woe, and think of us\\nAs of a father; for let the world take note\\nYou are the most immediate to our throne,\\nAnd with no less nobility of love\\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\\nAnd we beseech you bend you to remain\\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.\\nI pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\\n\\nKING.\\nWhy, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.\\nBe as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;\\nThis gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet\\nSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,\\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today\\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\\nAnd the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\\n\\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO that this too too solid flesh would melt,\\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew!\\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix’d\\nHis canon ’gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!\\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\\nFie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden\\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\\nBut two months dead—nay, not so much, not two:\\nSo excellent a king; that was to this\\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,\\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\\nBy what it fed on; and yet, within a month—\\nLet me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!\\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\\nWith which she followed my poor father’s body\\nLike Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she—\\nO God! A beast that wants discourse of reason\\nWould have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle,\\nMy father’s brother; but no more like my father\\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month?\\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\\nShe married. O most wicked speed, to post\\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\\nBut break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\\n\\nEnter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nHail to your lordship!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI am glad to see you well:\\nHoratio, or I do forget myself.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nThe same, my lord,\\nAnd your poor servant ever.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSir, my good friend;\\nI’ll change that name with you:\\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—\\nMarcellus?\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nMy good lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.—\\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI would not hear your enemy say so;\\nNor shall you do my ear that violence,\\nTo make it truster of your own report\\nAgainst yourself. I know you are no truant.\\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\\nWe’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nMy lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.\\nI think it was to see my mother’s wedding.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIndeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats\\nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven\\nOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio.\\nMy father,—methinks I see my father.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWhere, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIn my mind’s eye, Horatio.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nI saw him once; he was a goodly king.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHe was a man, take him for all in all,\\nI shall not look upon his like again.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSaw? Who?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nMy lord, the King your father.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThe King my father!\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nSeason your admiration for a while\\nWith an attent ear, till I may deliver\\nUpon the witness of these gentlemen\\nThis marvel to you.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nFor God’s love let me hear.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nTwo nights together had these gentlemen,\\nMarcellus and Barnardo, on their watch\\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night,\\nBeen thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,\\nArmed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,\\nAppears before them, and with solemn march\\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d\\nBy their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,\\nWithin his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d\\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\\nStand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me\\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\\nWhere, as they had deliver’d, both in time,\\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\\nThese hands are not more like.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nBut where was this?\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDid you not speak to it?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nMy lord, I did;\\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\\nItself to motion, like as it would speak.\\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\\nAnd vanish’d from our sight.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n’Tis very strange.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nAs I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;\\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\\nTo let you know of it.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\\nHold you the watch tonight?\\n\\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\\nWe do, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nArm’d, say you?\\n\\nBoth.\\nArm’d, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nFrom top to toe?\\n\\nBOTH.\\nMy lord, from head to foot.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThen saw you not his face?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nO yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat, look’d he frowningly?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nPale, or red?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nNay, very pale.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAnd fix’d his eyes upon you?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nMost constantly.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI would I had been there.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIt would have much amaz’d you.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nVery like, very like. Stay’d it long?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\\n\\nMARCELLUS and BARNARDO.\\nLonger, longer.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nNot when I saw’t.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHis beard was grizzled, no?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIt was, as I have seen it in his life,\\nA sable silver’d.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI will watch tonight;\\nPerchance ’twill walk again.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nI warrant you it will.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIf it assume my noble father’s person,\\nI’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\\nIf you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,\\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\\nAnd whatsoever else shall hap tonight,\\nGive it an understanding, but no tongue.\\nI will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.\\nUpon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve,\\nI’ll visit you.\\n\\nALL.\\nOur duty to your honour.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.\\n\\n[_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]\\n\\nMy father’s spirit in arms! All is not well;\\nI doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\\nTill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,\\nThough all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\n SCENE III. A room in Polonius’s house.\\n\\nEnter Laertes and Ophelia.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nMy necessaries are embark’d. Farewell.\\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\\nBut let me hear from you.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nDo you doubt that?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,\\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood;\\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;\\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\\nNo more.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nNo more but so?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nThink it no more.\\nFor nature crescent does not grow alone\\nIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,\\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\\nHis greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;\\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\\nHe may not, as unvalu’d persons do,\\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\\nThe sanctity and health of this whole state;\\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d\\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\\nAs he in his particular act and place\\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\\nTo his unmaster’d importunity.\\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\\nVirtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:\\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos’d,\\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\\nBe wary then, best safety lies in fear.\\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nI shall th’effect of this good lesson keep\\nAs watchman to my heart. But good my brother,\\nDo not as some ungracious pastors do,\\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\\nWhilst like a puff’d and reckless libertine\\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\\nAnd recks not his own rede.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nO, fear me not.\\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\\n\\nEnter Polonius.\\n\\nA double blessing is a double grace;\\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.\\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\\nAnd you are stay’d for. There, my blessing with you.\\n\\n[_Laying his hand on Laertes’s head._]\\n\\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\\nNor any unproportion’d thought his act.\\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;\\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\\nOf each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware\\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but being in,\\nBear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee.\\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\\nTake each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgement.\\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\\nBut not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\\nThis above all: to thine own self be true;\\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\\nWhat I have said to you.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\n’Tis in my memory lock’d,\\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nFarewell.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nWhat is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMarry, well bethought:\\n’Tis told me he hath very oft of late\\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.\\nIf it be so,—as so ’tis put on me,\\nAnd that in way of caution,—I must tell you\\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\\nAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.\\nWhat is between you? Give me up the truth.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\\nOf his affection to me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nAffection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,\\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\\nDo you believe his tenders, as you call them?\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMarry, I’ll teach you; think yourself a baby;\\nThat you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,\\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\\nOr,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\\nRoaming it thus,—you’ll tender me a fool.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nMy lord, he hath importun’d me with love\\nIn honourable fashion.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both,\\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,\\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\\nBelieve so much in him that he is young;\\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\\nThe better to beguile. This is for all.\\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\\nLook to’t, I charge you; come your ways.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nI shall obey, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE IV.

I heard it not. It then draws near the season\\nWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\\n\\n[_A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within._]\\n\\nWhat does this mean, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThe King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,\\nKeeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels;\\nAnd as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\\nThe kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out\\nThe triumph of his pledge.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIs it a custom?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy marry is’t;\\nAnd to my mind, though I am native here,\\nAnd to the manner born, it is a custom\\nMore honour’d in the breach than the observance.\\nThis heavy-headed revel east and west\\nMakes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations:\\nThey clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase\\nSoil our addition; and indeed it takes\\nFrom our achievements, though perform’d at height,\\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\\nSo oft it chances in particular men\\nThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,\\nAs in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,\\nSince nature cannot choose his origin,\\nBy their o’ergrowth of some complexion,\\nOft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;\\nOr by some habit, that too much o’erleavens\\nThe form of plausive manners;—that these men,\\nCarrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\\nBeing Nature’s livery or Fortune’s star,—\\nHis virtues else,—be they as pure as grace,\\nAs infinite as man may undergo,\\nShall in the general censure take corruption\\nFrom that particular fault. The dram of evil\\nDoth all the noble substance often doubt\\nTo his own scandal.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nLook, my lord, it comes!\\n\\nEnter Ghost.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAngels and ministers of grace defend us!\\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d,\\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,\\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\\nThou com’st in such a questionable shape\\nThat I will speak to thee.

O, answer me!\\nLet me not burst in ignorance; but tell\\nWhy thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death,\\nHave burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,\\nWherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,\\nHath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws\\nTo cast thee up again! What may this mean,\\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,\\nRevisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon,\\nMaking night hideous, and we fools of nature\\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\\nSay, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?\\n\\n[_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIt beckons you to go away with it,\\nAs if it some impartment did desire\\nTo you alone.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nLook with what courteous action\\nIt waves you to a more removed ground.\\nBut do not go with it.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nNo, by no means.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIt will not speak; then will I follow it.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nDo not, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, what should be the fear?\\nI do not set my life at a pin’s fee;\\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\\nIt waves me forth again.

But that I am forbid\\nTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,\\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\\nWould harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,\\nMake thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,\\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\\nAnd each particular hair to stand on end\\nLike quills upon the fretful porcupine.\\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!\\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love—\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO God!\\n\\nGHOST.\\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nMurder!\\n\\nGHOST.\\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is;\\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHaste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift\\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love\\nMay sweep to my revenge.\\n\\nGHOST.\\nI find thee apt;\\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\\nThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\\n’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\\nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\\nIs by a forged process of my death\\nRankly abus’d; but know, thou noble youth,\\nThe serpent that did sting thy father’s life\\nNow wears his crown.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO my prophetic soul!\\nMine uncle!\\n\\nGHOST.\\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—\\nO wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power\\nSo to seduce!—won to his shameful lust\\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there,\\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\\nI made to her in marriage; and to decline\\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\\nTo those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov’d,\\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;\\nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,\\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\\nAnd prey on garbage.\\nBut soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\\nThe leperous distilment, whose effect\\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body;\\nAnd with a sudden vigour it doth posset\\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;\\nAnd a most instant tetter bark’d about,\\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\\nAll my smooth body.\\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand,\\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch’d:\\nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\\nUnhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d;\\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account\\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\\nO horrible! O horrible! most horrible!\\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\\nBut howsoever thou pursu’st this act,\\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\\nAgainst thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,\\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\\nThe glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\\nAnd ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Hamlet, remember me.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?\\nAnd shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;\\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\\nYea, from the table of my memory\\nI’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,\\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\\nThat youth and observation copied there;\\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\\nUnmix’d with baser matter.

Touching this vision here,\\nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.\\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\\nO’ermaster’t as you may. And now, good friends,\\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\\nGive me one poor request.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWhat is’t, my lord? We will.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\\n\\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\\nMy lord, we will not.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNay, but swear’t.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIn faith, my lord, not I.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nNor I, my lord, in faith.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nUpon my sword.\\n\\nMARCELLUS.\\nWe have sworn, my lord, already.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.\\n\\nGHOST.\\n[_Cries under the stage._] Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHa, ha boy, say’st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?\\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\\nConsent to swear.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nPropose the oath, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNever to speak of this that you have seen.\\nSwear by my sword.\\n\\nGHOST.\\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n_Hic et ubique?_ Then we’ll shift our ground.\\nCome hither, gentlemen,\\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\\nSwear by my sword.\\n\\nGHOST.\\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWell said, old mole!

Look you, sir,\\nEnquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\\nAnd how, and who, what means, and where they keep,\\nWhat company, at what expense; and finding\\nBy this encompassment and drift of question,\\nThat they do know my son, come you more nearer\\nThan your particular demands will touch it.\\nTake you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him,\\nAs thus, ‘I know his father and his friends,\\nAnd in part him’—do you mark this, Reynaldo?\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nAy, very well, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\n‘And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well;\\nBut if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;\\nAddicted so and so;’ and there put on him\\nWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rank\\nAs may dishonour him; take heed of that;\\nBut, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips\\nAs are companions noted and most known\\nTo youth and liberty.\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nAs gaming, my lord?\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nAy, or drinking, fencing, swearing,\\nQuarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nMy lord, that would dishonour him.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nFaith no, as you may season it in the charge.\\nYou must not put another scandal on him,\\nThat he is open to incontinency;\\nThat’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly\\nThat they may seem the taints of liberty;\\nThe flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\\nA savageness in unreclaimed blood,\\nOf general assault.\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nBut my good lord—\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nWherefore should you do this?\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nAy, my lord, I would know that.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMarry, sir, here’s my drift,\\nAnd I believe it is a fetch of warrant.\\nYou laying these slight sullies on my son,\\nAs ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ th’ working,\\nMark you,\\nYour party in converse, him you would sound,\\nHaving ever seen in the prenominate crimes\\nThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d\\nHe closes with you in this consequence;\\n‘Good sir,’ or so; or ‘friend,’ or ‘gentleman’—\\nAccording to the phrase or the addition\\nOf man and country.\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nVery good, my lord.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nAnd then, sir, does he this,—\\nHe does—What was I about to say?\\nBy the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?\\n\\nREYNALDO.\\nAt ‘closes in the consequence.’\\nAt ‘friend or so,’ and ‘gentleman.’\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nAt ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry!\\nHe closes with you thus: ‘I know the gentleman,\\nI saw him yesterday, or t’other day,\\nOr then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say,\\nThere was he gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse,\\nThere falling out at tennis’: or perchance,\\n‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’—\\n_Videlicet_, a brothel, or so forth. See you now;\\nYour bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;\\nAnd thus do we of wisdom and of reach,\\nWith windlasses, and with assays of bias,\\nBy indirections find directions out.\\nSo by my former lecture and advice\\nShall you my son.

Long stay’d he so,\\nAt last,—a little shaking of mine arm,\\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\\nHe rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound\\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,\\nAnd with his head over his shoulder turn’d\\nHe seem’d to find his way without his eyes,\\nFor out o’ doors he went without their help,\\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nCome, go with me. I will go seek the King.\\nThis is the very ecstasy of love,\\nWhose violent property fordoes itself,\\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings,\\nAs oft as any passion under heaven\\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry,—\\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nNo, my good lord; but as you did command,\\nI did repel his letters and denied\\nHis access to me.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nThat hath made him mad.\\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgement\\nI had not quoted him. I fear’d he did but trifle,\\nAnd meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!\\nIt seems it is as proper to our age\\nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\\nAs it is common for the younger sort\\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.\\nThis must be known, which, being kept close, might move\\nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE II.

Something have you heard\\nOf Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it,\\nSince nor th’exterior nor the inward man\\nResembles that it was.

For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey\\nbeards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber\\nand plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together\\nwith most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and\\npotently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down.\\nFor you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could\\ngo backward.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\n[_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in’t.—\\nWill you walk out of the air, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nInto my grave?\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nIndeed, that is out o’ the air.

Good lads, how do ye both?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nHappy in that we are not over-happy;\\nOn Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNor the soles of her shoe?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nNeither, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nFaith, her privates we.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIn the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s\\nthe news?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nNone, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThen is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more\\nin particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of\\nFortune, that she sends you to prison hither?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nPrison, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDenmark’s a prison.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nThen is the world one.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons,\\nDenmark being one o’ th’ worst.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nWe think not so, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but\\nthinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nWhy, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of\\ninfinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nWhich dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the\\nambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is\\nbut a shadow’s shadow.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes\\nthe beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot\\nreason.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\\nWe’ll wait upon you.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNo such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for,\\nto speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,\\nin the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nTo visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure,\\ndear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent\\nfor? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal\\njustly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nWhat should we say, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a\\nkind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft\\nenough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nTo what end, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our\\nfellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our\\never-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could\\ncharge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent\\nfor or no.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\n[_To Guildenstern._] What say you?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n[_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not\\noff.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nMy lord, we were sent for.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery,\\nand your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of\\nlate, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom\\nof exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that\\nthis goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this\\nmost excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging\\nfirmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it\\nappears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of\\nvapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite\\nin faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in action\\nhow like an angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of the\\nworld, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this\\nquintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,\\nthough by your smiling you seem to say so.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment\\nthe players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and\\nhither are they coming to offer you service.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute\\nof me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover\\nshall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace;\\nthe clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’ sere;\\nand the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\\nfor’t. What players are they?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nEven those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the\\ncity.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and\\nprofit, was better both ways.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are\\nthey so followed?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nNo, indeed, they are not.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow comes it? Do they grow rusty?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an\\naerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question,\\nand are most tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion, and\\nso berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing\\nrapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will\\nthey pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say\\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is\\nmost like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to\\nmake them exclaim against their own succession?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nFaith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it\\nno sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money\\nbid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the\\nquestion.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIs’t possible?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDo the boys carry it away?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nAy, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIt is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that\\nwould make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty,\\nfifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood,\\nthere is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find\\nit out.\\n\\n[_Flourish of trumpets within._]\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nThere are the players.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The\\nappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you\\nin this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show\\nfairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You\\nare welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nIn what, my dear lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a\\nhawk from a handsaw.\\n\\nEnter Polonius.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nWell be with you, gentlemen.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great\\nbaby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nHappily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is\\ntwice a child.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say\\nright, sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nBuzz, buzz.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nUpon my honour.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThen came each actor on his ass—\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,\\npastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem\\nunlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the\\nlaw of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nWhat treasure had he, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy—\\n   ’One fair daughter, and no more,\\n   The which he loved passing well.’\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\n[_Aside._] Still on my daughter.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAm I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing\\nwell.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNay, that follows not.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nWhat follows then, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy,\\n   As by lot, God wot,\\nand then, you know,\\n   It came to pass, as most like it was.\\nThe first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where\\nmy abridgement comes.\\n\\nEnter four or five Players.\\n\\nYou are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.\\nWelcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I\\nsaw thee last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady\\nand mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I\\nsaw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a\\npiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you\\nare all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything\\nwe see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your\\nquality. Come, a passionate speech.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\nWhat speech, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it\\nwas, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million,\\n’twas caviare to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others,\\nwhose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent\\nplay, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as\\ncunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make\\nthe matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the\\nauthor of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\\nsweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I\\nchiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it\\nespecially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your\\nmemory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:\\n   _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—_\\nIt is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—\\n   _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\\n   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble\\n   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,\\n   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d\\n   With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot\\n   Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d\\n   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\\n   Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,\\n   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light\\n   To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,\\n   And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,\\n   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\\n   Old grandsire Priam seeks._\\nSo, proceed you.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\n’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\n   _Anon he finds him,\\n   Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\\n   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\\n   Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d,\\n   Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\\n   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\\n   Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\\n   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\\n   Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\\n   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,\\n   Which was declining on the milky head\\n   Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.\\n   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\\n   And like a neutral to his will and matter,\\n   Did nothing.\\n   But as we often see against some storm,\\n   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\\n   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\\n   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\\n   Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,\\n   Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\\n   And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall\\n   On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne,\\n   With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword\\n   Now falls on Priam.\\n   Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,\\n   In general synod, take away her power;\\n   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\\n   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\\n   As low as to the fiends._\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nThis is too long.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIt shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prythee say on.\\nHe’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.\\nSay on; come to Hecuba.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\n   _But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,—_\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n‘The mobled queen’?\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nThat’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\n   _Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames\\n   With bisson rheum. A clout upon that head\\n   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\\n   About her lank and all o’erteemed loins,\\n   A blanket, in th’alarm of fear caught up—\\n   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d,\\n   ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d.\\n   But if the gods themselves did see her then,\\n   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\\n   In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,\\n   The instant burst of clamour that she made,—\\n   Unless things mortal move them not at all,—\\n   Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\\n   And passion in the gods._\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nLook, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s eyes. Pray\\nyou, no more.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good my\\nlord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be\\nwell used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.\\nAfter your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill\\nreport while you live.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nGod’s bodikin, man, better. Use every man after his desert, and who\\nshould scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The\\nless they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nCome, sirs.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nFollow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.\\n\\n[_Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First._]\\n\\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\nAy, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWe’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some\\ndozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could\\nyou not?\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\nAy, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nVery well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.\\n\\n[_Exit First Player._]\\n\\n[_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, I’ll leave you\\ntill night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nGood my lord.\\n\\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone.\\nO what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\\nThat from her working all his visage wan’d;\\nTears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect,\\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\\nFor Hecuba?\\nWhat’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free,\\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,\\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\\nAnd can say nothing. No, not for a king\\nUpon whose property and most dear life\\nA damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?\\nWho calls me villain, breaks my pate across?\\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\\nTweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ th’ throat\\nAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?\\nHa! ’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\\nBut I am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall\\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\\nI should have fatted all the region kites\\nWith this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!\\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\\nOh vengeance!\\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder’d,\\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\\nA scullion! Fie upon’t! Foh!\\nAbout, my brain! I have heard\\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play,\\nHave by the very cunning of the scene,\\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\\nThey have proclaim’d their malefactions.\\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\\nWith most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players\\nPlay something like the murder of my father\\nBefore mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;\\nI’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,\\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\\nMay be the devil, and the devil hath power\\nT’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps\\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\\nAbuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds\\nMore relative than this. The play’s the thing\\nWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\nSCENE I.

Let’s withdraw, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exeunt King and Polonius._]\\n\\nEnter Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nTo be, or not to be, that is the question:\\nWhether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer\\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\\nAnd by opposing end them? To die—to sleep,\\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\\nThe heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks\\nThat flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation\\nDevoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep.\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,\\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\\nMust give us pause. There’s the respect\\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\\nThe oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,\\nThe pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay,\\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,\\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\\nBut that the dread of something after death,\\nThe undiscover’d country, from whose bourn\\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\\nIs sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,\\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment,\\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\\nAnd lose the name of action. Soft you now,\\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\\nBe all my sins remember’d.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nGood my lord,\\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI humbly thank you; well, well, well.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\\nI pray you, now receive them.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNo, not I.\\nI never gave you aught.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nMy honour’d lord, you know right well you did,\\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos’d\\nAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,\\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\\nThere, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHa, ha! Are you honest?\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nMy lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAre you fair?\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nWhat means your lordship?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse\\nto your beauty.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from\\nwhat it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty\\ninto his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives\\nit proof. I did love you once.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nYou should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old\\nstock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.\\n\\nOPHELIA.\\nI was the more deceived.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nGet thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am\\nmyself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things\\nthat it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud,\\nrevengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have\\nthoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act\\nthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and\\nheaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a\\nnunnery.

But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as\\nlief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much\\nwith your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent,\\ntempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and\\nbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the\\nsoul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to\\ntatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for\\nthe most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and\\nnoise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It\\nout-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\nI warrant your honour.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor.\\nSuit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special\\nobservance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything\\nso overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the\\nfirst and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature;\\nto show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age\\nand body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come\\ntardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the\\njudicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance\\no’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have\\nseen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it\\nprofanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait\\nof Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have\\nthought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them\\nwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.\\n\\nFIRST PLAYER.\\nI hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no\\nmore than is set down for them. For there be of them that will\\nthemselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh\\ntoo, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then\\nto be considered. That’s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition\\nin the fool that uses it.

Why should the poor be flatter’d?\\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,\\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice,\\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\\nHath seal’d thee for herself. For thou hast been\\nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,\\nA man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards\\nHast ta’en with equal thanks. And bles’d are those\\nWhose blood and judgement are so well co-mingled\\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger\\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\\nThat is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him\\nIn my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,\\nAs I do thee. Something too much of this.\\nThere is a play tonight before the King.\\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\\nWhich I have told thee, of my father’s death.\\nI prythee, when thou see’st that act a-foot,\\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\\nObserve mine uncle. If his occulted guilt\\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen;\\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\\nAs Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note;\\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face;\\nAnd after we will both our judgements join\\nIn censure of his seeming.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWell, my lord.\\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,\\nAnd scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThey are coming to the play.

Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of\\nsables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then\\nthere’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year.

Anon comes in a fellow,\\ntakes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ears, and\\nexits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate\\naction.

You do surely bar the\\ndoor upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSir, I lack advancement.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nHow can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your\\nsuccession in Denmark?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty.\\n\\nRe-enter the Players with recorders.\\n\\nO, the recorders. Let me see one.—To withdraw with you, why do you go\\nabout to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nO my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nMy lord, I cannot.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI pray you.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nBelieve me, I cannot.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI do beseech you.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nI know no touch of it, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger and\\nthumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most\\neloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nBut these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. I have not the\\nskill.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play\\nupon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart\\nof my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my\\ncompass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little\\norgan, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier\\nto be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though\\nyou can fret me, you cannot play upon me.\\n\\nEnter Polonius.\\n\\nGod bless you, sir.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMy lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDo you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nBy the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nMethinks it is like a weasel.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nIt is backed like a weasel.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nOr like a whale.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nVery like a whale.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThen will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the top of my\\nbent.—I will come by and by.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nI will say so.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nBy and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.\\n\\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]\\n\\n’Tis now the very witching time of night,\\nWhen churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out\\nContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,\\nAnd do such bitter business as the day\\nWould quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother.\\nO heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever\\nThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:\\nLet me be cruel, not unnatural.\\nI will speak daggers to her, but use none;\\nMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.\\nHow in my words somever she be shent,\\nTo give them seals never, my soul, consent.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\n SCENE III.

Therefore prepare you,\\nI your commission will forthwith dispatch,\\nAnd he to England shall along with you.\\nThe terms of our estate may not endure\\nHazard so near us as doth hourly grow\\nOut of his lunacies.\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nWe will ourselves provide.\\nMost holy and religious fear it is\\nTo keep those many many bodies safe\\nThat live and feed upon your Majesty.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nThe single and peculiar life is bound\\nWith all the strength and armour of the mind,\\nTo keep itself from ’noyance; but much more\\nThat spirit upon whose weal depend and rest\\nThe lives of many. The cease of majesty\\nDies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw\\nWhat’s near it with it. It is a massy wheel\\nFix’d on the summit of the highest mount,\\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\\nAre mortis’d and adjoin’d; which when it falls,\\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\\nAttends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone\\nDid the King sigh, but with a general groan.\\n\\nKING.\\nArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;\\nFor we will fetters put upon this fear,\\nWhich now goes too free-footed.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\\nWe will haste us.\\n\\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\\n\\nEnter Polonius.\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\nMy lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.\\nBehind the arras I’ll convey myself\\nTo hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home,\\nAnd as you said, and wisely was it said,\\n’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\\nSince nature makes them partial, should o’erhear\\nThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,\\nI’ll call upon you ere you go to bed,\\nAnd tell you what I know.\\n\\nKING.\\nThanks, dear my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit Polonius._]\\n\\nO, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;\\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon’t,—\\nA brother’s murder! Pray can I not,\\nThough inclination be as sharp as will:\\nMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,\\nAnd, like a man to double business bound,\\nI stand in pause where I shall first begin,\\nAnd both neglect. What if this cursed hand\\nWere thicker than itself with brother’s blood,\\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\\nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\\nBut to confront the visage of offence?\\nAnd what’s in prayer but this twofold force,\\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\\nOr pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up.\\nMy fault is past. But O, what form of prayer\\nCan serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!\\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess’d\\nOf those effects for which I did the murder,—\\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\\nMay one be pardon’d and retain th’offence?\\nIn the corrupted currents of this world\\nOffence’s gilded hand may shove by justice,\\nAnd oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself\\nBuys out the law. But ’tis not so above;\\nThere is no shuffling, there the action lies\\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d\\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\\nTo give in evidence. What then? What rests?\\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\\nYet what can it, when one cannot repent?\\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\\nO limed soul, that struggling to be free,\\nArt more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay:\\nBow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,\\nBe soft as sinews of the new-born babe.\\nAll may be well.\\n\\n[_Retires and kneels._]\\n\\nEnter Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNow might I do it pat, now he is praying.\\nAnd now I’ll do’t. And so he goes to heaven;\\nAnd so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d:\\nA villain kills my father, and for that\\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\\nTo heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\\nAnd how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?\\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought,\\n’Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d,\\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\\nWhen he is fit and season’d for his passage? No.\\nUp, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:\\nWhen he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,\\nOr in th’incestuous pleasure of his bed,\\nAt gaming, swearing; or about some act\\nThat has no relish of salvation in’t,\\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\\nAnd that his soul may be as damn’d and black\\nAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.\\nThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\nThe King rises and advances.\\n\\nKING.\\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below.\\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\n SCENE IV.

Look you lay home to him,\\nTell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,\\nAnd that your Grace hath screen’d and stood between\\nMuch heat and him. I’ll silence me e’en here.\\nPray you be round with him.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n[_Within._] Mother, mother, mother.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nI’ll warrant you, Fear me not.\\nWithdraw, I hear him coming.\\n\\n[_Polonius goes behind the arras._]\\n\\nEnter Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNow, mother, what’s the matter?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nMother, you have my father much offended.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nWhy, how now, Hamlet?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat’s the matter now?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nHave you forgot me?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNo, by the rood, not so.\\nYou are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,\\nAnd, would it were not so. You are my mother.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nNay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nCome, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.\\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\\nHelp, help, ho!\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\n[_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow now? A rat? [_Draws._]\\nDead for a ducat, dead!\\n\\n[_Makes a pass through the arras._]\\n\\nPOLONIUS.\\n[_Behind._] O, I am slain!\\n\\n[_Falls and dies._]\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nO me, what hast thou done?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNay, I know not. Is it the King?\\n\\n[_Draws forth Polonius._]\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nO what a rash and bloody deed is this!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nA bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,\\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nAs kill a king?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, lady, ’twas my word.—\\n[_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!\\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,\\nThou find’st to be too busy is some danger.—\\nLeave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,\\nAnd let me wring your heart, for so I shall,\\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff;\\nIf damned custom have not braz’d it so,\\nThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nWhat have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue\\nIn noise so rude against me?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSuch an act\\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\\nAnd sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows\\nAs false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed\\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\\nA rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow,\\nYea this solidity and compound mass,\\nWith tristful visage, as against the doom,\\nIs thought-sick at the act.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nAy me, what act,\\nThat roars so loud, and thunders in the index?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nLook here upon this picture, and on this,\\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\\nHyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,\\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten and command,\\nA station like the herald Mercury\\nNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:\\nA combination and a form indeed,\\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal,\\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\\nHere is your husband, like a mildew’d ear\\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\\nYou cannot call it love; for at your age\\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,\\nAnd waits upon the judgement: and what judgement\\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\\nIs apoplex’d, for madness would not err\\nNor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d\\nBut it reserv’d some quantity of choice\\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was’t\\nThat thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?\\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\\nCould not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?\\nRebellious hell,\\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,\\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\\nWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\\nAnd reason panders will.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nO Hamlet, speak no more.\\nThou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul,\\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\\nAs will not leave their tinct.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNay, but to live\\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\\nStew’d in corruption, honeying and making love\\nOver the nasty sty.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nO speak to me no more;\\nThese words like daggers enter in mine ears;\\nNo more, sweet Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nA murderer and a villain;\\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\\nOf your precedent lord. A vice of kings,\\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\\nAnd put it in his pocket!\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nNo more.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nA king of shreds and patches!—\\n\\nEnter Ghost.\\n\\nSave me and hover o’er me with your wings,\\nYou heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nAlas, he’s mad.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\\nThat, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by\\nThe important acting of your dread command?\\nO say!\\n\\nGHOST.\\nDo not forget. This visitation\\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\\nO step between her and her fighting soul.\\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow is it with you, lady?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nAlas, how is’t with you,\\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy,\\nAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\\nYour bedded hairs, like life in excrements,\\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\\nSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,\\nHis form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,\\nWould make them capable.—Do not look upon me,\\nLest with this piteous action you convert\\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\\nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nTo whom do you speak this?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDo you see nothing there?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNor did you nothing hear?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nNo, nothing but ourselves.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, look you there! look how it steals away!\\nMy father, in his habit as he liv’d!\\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal.\\n\\n[_Exit Ghost._]\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\\nIs very cunning in.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nEcstasy!\\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,\\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\\nThat I have utter’d. Bring me to the test,\\nAnd I the matter will re-word; which madness\\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\\nThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks.\\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\\nWhilst rank corruption, mining all within,\\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\\nRepent what’s past, avoid what is to come;\\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds,\\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\\nFor in the fatness of these pursy times\\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nO throw away the worser part of it,\\nAnd live the purer with the other half.\\nGood night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed.\\nAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\\nThat monster custom, who all sense doth eat,\\nOf habits evil, is angel yet in this,\\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\\nTo the next abstinence. The next more easy;\\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature,\\nAnd either curb the devil, or throw him out\\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\\nAnd when you are desirous to be bles’d,\\nI’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\\n[_Pointing to Polonius._]\\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so,\\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\\nThe death I gave him. So again, good night.\\nI must be cruel, only to be kind:\\nThus bad begins, and worse remains behind.\\nOne word more, good lady.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nWhat shall I do?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\\nLet the bloat King tempt you again to bed,\\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,\\nOr paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers,\\nMake you to ravel all this matter out,\\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\\nBut mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,\\nFor who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\\nUnpeg the basket on the house’s top,\\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\\nAnd break your own neck down.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nBe thou assur’d, if words be made of breath,\\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\\nWhat thou hast said to me.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI must to England, you know that?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nAlack,\\nI had forgot. ’Tis so concluded on.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThere’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows,\\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fang’d,—\\nThey bear the mandate, they must sweep my way\\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\\nFor ’tis the sport to have the enginer\\nHoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard\\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\\nAnd blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet,\\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.\\nThis man shall set me packing.\\nI’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.\\nMother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor\\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\\nWho was in life a foolish prating knave.\\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you.\\nGood night, mother.\\n\\n[_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT IV\\n\\nSCENE I. A room in the Castle.\\n\\n\\nEnter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\\n\\nKING.\\nThere’s matter in these sighs.

How does Hamlet?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nMad as the sea and wind, when both contend\\nWhich is the mightier. In his lawless fit\\nBehind the arras hearing something stir,\\nWhips out his rapier, cries ‘A rat, a rat!’\\nAnd in this brainish apprehension kills\\nThe unseen good old man.\\n\\nKING.\\nO heavy deed!\\nIt had been so with us, had we been there.\\nHis liberty is full of threats to all;\\nTo you yourself, to us, to everyone.\\nAlas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d?\\nIt will be laid to us, whose providence\\nShould have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt\\nThis mad young man. But so much was our love\\nWe would not understand what was most fit,\\nBut like the owner of a foul disease,\\nTo keep it from divulging, let it feed\\nEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nTo draw apart the body he hath kill’d,\\nO’er whom his very madness, like some ore\\nAmong a mineral of metals base,\\nShows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.\\n\\nKING.\\nO Gertrude, come away!\\nThe sun no sooner shall the mountains touch\\nBut we will ship him hence, and this vile deed\\nWe must with all our majesty and skill\\nBoth countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!\\n\\nRe-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\\n\\nFriends both, go join you with some further aid:\\nHamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,\\nAnd from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him.\\nGo seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body\\nInto the chapel. I pray you haste in this.\\n\\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\\n\\nCome, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends,\\nAnd let them know both what we mean to do\\nAnd what’s untimely done, so haply slander,\\nWhose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,\\nAs level as the cannon to his blank,\\nTransports his poison’d shot, may miss our name,\\nAnd hit the woundless air. O, come away!\\nMy soul is full of discord and dismay.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE II.

Besides, to be demanded\\nof a sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king?\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nTake you me for a sponge, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, sir; that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his\\nauthorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: he\\nkeeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be\\nlast swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but\\nsqueezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nI understand you not, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.\\n\\nROSENCRANTZ.\\nMy lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThe body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King\\nis a thing—\\n\\nGUILDENSTERN.\\nA thing, my lord!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nOf nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE III.

To bear all smooth and even,\\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\\nDeliberate pause.

Where?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNot where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of\\npolitic worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet.\\nWe fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.\\nYour fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes,\\nbut to one table.

Therefore prepare thyself;\\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\\nTh’associates tend, and everything is bent\\nFor England.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nFor England?\\n\\nKING.\\nAy, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nGood.\\n\\nKING.\\nSo is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear\\nmother.\\n\\nKING.\\nThy loving father, Hamlet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one\\nflesh; and so, my mother.

They have letters for him. Ere we were\\ntwo days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us\\nchase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled\\nvalour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got\\nclear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt\\nwith me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do\\na good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and\\nrepair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have\\nwords to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee\\nwhere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:\\nof them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.\\n     He that thou knowest thine,\\n     HAMLET.’\\n\\nCome, I will give you way for these your letters,\\nAnd do’t the speedier, that you may direct me\\nTo him from whom you brought them.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.\\n\\nEnter King and Laertes.\\n\\nKING.\\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\\nPursu’d my life.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nIt well appears. But tell me\\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\\nSo crimeful and so capital in nature,\\nAs by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\\nYou mainly were stirr’d up.\\n\\nKING.\\nO, for two special reasons,\\nWhich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,\\nBut yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother\\nLives almost by his looks; and for myself,—\\nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,—\\nShe’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,\\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\\nI could not but by her. The other motive,\\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\\nWould like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\\nToo slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,\\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\\nAnd not where I had aim’d them.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\\nA sister driven into desperate terms,\\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\\n\\nKING.\\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\\nI lov’d your father, and we love ourself,\\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—\\n\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\nHow now? What news?\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet.\\nThis to your Majesty; this to the Queen.\\n\\nKING.\\nFrom Hamlet! Who brought them?\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.\\nThey were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them\\nOf him that brought them.\\n\\nKING.\\nLaertes, you shall hear them.\\nLeave us.\\n\\n[_Exit Messenger._]\\n\\n[_Reads._] ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\\nkingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I\\nshall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my\\nsudden and more strange return.\\n     HAMLET.’\\n\\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\\nOr is it some abuse, and no such thing?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nKnow you the hand?\\n\\nKING.\\n’Tis Hamlet’s character. ‘Naked!’\\nAnd in a postscript here he says ‘alone.’\\nCan you advise me?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,\\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\\n‘Thus diest thou.’\\n\\nKING.\\nIf it be so, Laertes,—\\nAs how should it be so? How otherwise?—\\nWill you be rul’d by me?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nAy, my lord;\\nSo you will not o’errule me to a peace.\\n\\nKING.\\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return’d,\\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\\nTo exploit, now ripe in my device,\\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe,\\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\\nAnd call it accident.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nMy lord, I will be rul’d;\\nThe rather if you could devise it so\\nThat I might be the organ.\\n\\nKING.\\nIt falls right.\\nYou have been talk’d of since your travel much,\\nAnd that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality\\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\\nOf the unworthiest siege.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nWhat part is that, my lord?\\n\\nKING.\\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,—\\nI’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,\\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\\nHad witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat,\\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\\nAs had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d\\nWith the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought\\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks,\\nCome short of what he did.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nA Norman was’t?\\n\\nKING.\\nA Norman.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nUpon my life, Lamond.\\n\\nKING.\\nThe very same.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\\nAnd gem of all the nation.\\n\\nKING.\\nHe made confession of you,\\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\\nThat he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed\\nIf one could match you. The scrimers of their nation\\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\\nIf you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his\\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\\nYour sudden coming o’er to play with him.\\nNow, out of this,—\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nWhat out of this, my lord?\\n\\nKING.\\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nWhy ask you this?\\n\\nKING.\\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\\nThere lives within the very flame of love\\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still,\\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\\nDies in his own too much. That we would do,\\nWe should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes,\\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\\nAnd then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh\\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer:\\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\\nTo show yourself your father’s son in deed,\\nMore than in words?\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nTo cut his throat i’ th’ church.\\n\\nKING.\\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\\nRevenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,\\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\\nHamlet return’d shall know you are come home:\\nWe’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,\\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,\\nRequite him for your father.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nI will do’t.\\nAnd for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.\\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\\nThis is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point\\nWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\\nIt may be death.\\n\\nKING.\\nLet’s further think of this,\\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\\n’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project\\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\\nWe’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,—\\nI ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,\\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,\\nAnd that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him\\nA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\\nIf he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,\\nOur purpose may hold there.\\n\\nEnter Queen.\\n\\nHow now, sweet Queen?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nOne woe doth tread upon another’s heel,\\nSo fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nDrown’d! O, where?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\\nThat shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.\\nThere with fantastic garlands did she make\\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\\nBut our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them.\\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\\nClamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\\nAnd mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,\\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\\nOr like a creature native and indued\\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\\nPull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay\\nTo muddy death.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nAlas, then she is drown’d?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nDrown’d, drown’d.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\\nThe woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,\\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,\\nBut that this folly douts it.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\nKING.\\nLet’s follow, Gertrude;\\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\\nNow fear I this will give it start again;\\nTherefore let’s follow.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT V\\n\\nSCENE I.

The crowner\\nhath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nHow can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nWhy, ’tis found so.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nIt must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For here lies the point:\\nif I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three\\nbranches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned\\nherself wittingly.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,—\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If\\nthe man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he\\ngoes,—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he\\ndrowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death\\nshortens not his own life.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nBut is this law?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nAy, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nWill you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she\\nshould have been buried out o’ Christian burial.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nWhy, there thou say’st. And the more pity that great folk should have\\ncountenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their\\neven Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but\\ngardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nWas he a gentleman?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nHe was the first that ever bore arms.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nWhy, he had none.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nWhat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The\\nScripture says Adam digg’d. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another\\nquestion to thee.

But how does\\nit well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say\\nthe gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may\\ndo well to thee. To’t again, come.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nWho builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nAy, tell me that, and unyoke.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nMarry, now I can tell.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nTo’t.\\n\\nSECOND CLOWN.\\nMass, I cannot tell.\\n\\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nCudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his\\npace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say ‘a\\ngrave-maker’. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to\\nYaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.\\n\\n[_Exit Second Clown._]\\n\\n[_Digs and sings._]\\n\\n   In youth when I did love, did love,\\n     Methought it was very sweet;\\n   To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,\\n     O methought there was nothing meet.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHas this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at\\ngrave-making?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nCustom hath made it in him a property of easiness.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\n[_Sings._]\\n   But age with his stealing steps\\n     Hath claw’d me in his clutch,\\n   And hath shipp’d me into the land,\\n     As if I had never been such.\\n\\n[_Throws up a skull._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls\\nit to th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first\\nmurder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now\\no’er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIt might, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nOr of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost\\nthou, good lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my\\nlord such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nAy, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the\\nmazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the\\ntrick to see’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play\\nat loggets with ’em? Mine ache to think on’t.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\n[_Sings._]\\n   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,\\n     For and a shrouding-sheet;\\n   O, a pit of clay for to be made\\n     For such a guest is meet.\\n\\n[_Throws up another skull._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThere’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be\\nhis quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?\\nWhy does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce\\nwith a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?\\nHum. This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his\\nstatutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his\\nrecoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his\\nrecoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers\\nvouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the\\nlength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his\\nlands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself\\nhave no more, ha?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nNot a jot more, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIs not parchment made of sheep-skins?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nAy, my lord, and of calf-skins too.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThey are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.

We must speak by the card, or equivocation\\nwill undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note\\nof it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so\\nnear the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou\\nbeen a grave-maker?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nOf all the days i’ th’ year, I came to’t that day that our last King\\nHamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow long is that since?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nCannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day\\nthat young Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAy, marry, why was he sent into England?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nWhy, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do\\nnot, it’s no great matter there.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\n’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow came he mad?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nVery strangely, they say.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow strangely?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nFaith, e’en with losing his wits.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nUpon what ground?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nWhy, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty\\nyears.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nFaith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses\\nnowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some\\neight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy he more than another?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nWhy, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out\\nwater a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson\\ndead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth\\nthree-and-twenty years.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhose was it?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nA whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNay, I know not.\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nA pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my\\nhead once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThis?\\n\\nFIRST CLOWN.\\nE’en that.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nLet me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,\\nHoratio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath\\nborne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my\\nimagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I\\nhave kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols?\\nyour songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table\\non a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen?\\nNow get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch\\nthick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prythee,\\nHoratio, tell me one thing.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWhat’s that, my lord?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nE’en so.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAnd smelt so? Pah!\\n\\n[_Throws down the skull._]\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nE’en so, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace\\nthe noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\n’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNo, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough,\\nand likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was\\nburied, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we\\nmake loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not\\nstop a beer-barrel?\\nImperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,\\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\\nO, that that earth which kept the world in awe\\nShould patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw.\\nBut soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.\\n\\nEnter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and\\nMourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.\\n\\nThe Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?\\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\\nThe corse they follow did with desperate hand\\nFordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.\\nCouch we awhile and mark.\\n\\n[_Retiring with Horatio._]\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nWhat ceremony else?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThat is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nWhat ceremony else?\\n\\nPRIEST.\\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarg’d\\nAs we have warranties. Her death was doubtful;\\nAnd but that great command o’ersways the order,\\nShe should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d\\nTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,\\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.\\nYet here she is allowed her virgin rites,\\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\\nOf bell and burial.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nMust there no more be done?\\n\\nPRIEST.\\nNo more be done.\\nWe should profane the service of the dead\\nTo sing sage requiem and such rest to her\\nAs to peace-parted souls.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nLay her i’ th’earth,\\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\\nMay violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,\\nA minist’ring angel shall my sister be\\nWhen thou liest howling.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat, the fair Ophelia?\\n\\nQUEEN.\\n[_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.\\nI hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;\\nI thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,\\nAnd not have strew’d thy grave.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nO, treble woe\\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\\nDepriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while,\\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.\\n[_Leaps into the grave._]\\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made,\\nTo o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\\nOf blue Olympus.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n[_Advancing._]\\nWhat is he whose grief\\nBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow\\nConjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand\\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\\nHamlet the Dane.\\n[_Leaps into the grave._]\\n\\nLAERTES.\\n[_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThou pray’st not well.\\nI prythee take thy fingers from my throat;\\nFor though I am not splenative and rash,\\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\\nWhich let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!\\n\\nKING.\\nPluck them asunder.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nHamlet! Hamlet!\\n\\nAll.\\nGentlemen!\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nGood my lord, be quiet.\\n\\n[_The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nO my son, what theme?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers\\nCould not, with all their quantity of love,\\nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\\n\\nKING.\\nO, he is mad, Laertes.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nFor love of God forbear him!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\n’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do:\\nWoul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself?\\nWoul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?\\nI’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine?\\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I.\\nAnd if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,\\nI’ll rant as well as thou.\\n\\nQUEEN.\\nThis is mere madness:\\nAnd thus awhile the fit will work on him;\\nAnon, as patient as the female dove,\\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclos’d,\\nHis silence will sit drooping.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHear you, sir;\\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\\nI lov’d you ever. But it is no matter.\\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\\n\\n[_Exit._]\\n\\nKING.\\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.\\n\\n[_Exit Horatio._]\\n\\n[_To Laertes_]\\nStrengthen your patience in our last night’s speech;\\nWe’ll put the matter to the present push.—\\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.\\nThis grave shall have a living monument.\\nAn hour of quiet shortly shall we see;\\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\\n\\n[_Exeunt._]\\n\\n SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.\\n\\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSo much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;\\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nRemember it, my lord!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\\nWorse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,\\nAnd prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know,\\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well,\\nWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us\\nThere’s a divinity that shapes our ends,\\nRough-hew them how we will.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nThat is most certain.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nUp from my cabin,\\nMy sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark\\nGrop’d I to find out them; had my desire,\\nFinger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew\\nTo mine own room again, making so bold,\\nMy fears forgetting manners, to unseal\\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\\nOh royal knavery! an exact command,\\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons,\\nImporting Denmark’s health, and England’s too,\\nWith ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,\\nThat on the supervise, no leisure bated,\\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\\nMy head should be struck off.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIs’t possible?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHere’s the commission, read it at more leisure.\\nBut wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nI beseech you.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nBeing thus benetted round with villanies,—\\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\\nThey had begun the play,—I sat me down,\\nDevis’d a new commission, wrote it fair:\\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\\nA baseness to write fair, and labour’d much\\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\\nIt did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know\\nThe effect of what I wrote?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nAy, good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nAn earnest conjuration from the King,\\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\\nAnd stand a comma ’tween their amities,\\nAnd many such-like ‘as’es of great charge,\\nThat on the view and know of these contents,\\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,\\nNot shriving-time allow’d.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nHow was this seal’d?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\\nI had my father’s signet in my purse,\\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal:\\nFolded the writ up in the form of the other,\\nSubscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely,\\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\\nWas our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent\\nThou know’st already.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.\\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat\\nDoes by their own insinuation grow.\\n’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\\nOf mighty opposites.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nWhy, what a king is this!\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nDoes it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—\\nHe that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,\\nPopp’d in between th’election and my hopes,\\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\\nAnd with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience\\nTo quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d\\nTo let this canker of our nature come\\nIn further evil?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIt will be short. The interim is mine;\\nAnd a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’.\\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;\\nFor by the image of my cause I see\\nThe portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.\\nBut sure the bravery of his grief did put me\\nInto a tow’ring passion.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nPeace, who comes here?\\n\\nEnter Osric.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nNo, my good lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath\\nmuch land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib\\nshall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious\\nin the possession of dirt.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing\\nto you from his Majesty.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his\\nright use; ’tis for the head.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nI thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNo, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nMethinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how.\\nBut, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a\\ngreat wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI beseech you, remember,—\\n\\n[_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nNay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly\\ncome to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most\\nexcellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed,\\nto speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for\\nyou shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to\\ndivide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet\\nbut yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of\\nextolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of\\nsuch dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable\\nis his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThe concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer\\nbreath?\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nSir?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIs’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir,\\nreally.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nOf Laertes?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nHis purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nOf him, sir.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nI know you are not ignorant,—\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much\\napprove me. Well, sir?\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence;\\nbut to know a man well were to know himself.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them\\nin his meed he’s unfellowed.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat’s his weapon?\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nRapier and dagger.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThat’s two of his weapons. But well.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nThe King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the\\nwhich he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards,\\nwith their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages,\\nin faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most\\ndelicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nWhat call you the carriages?\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nI knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon\\nby our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six\\nBarbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three\\nliberal conceited carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish.\\nWhy is this all imponed, as you call it?\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nThe King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he\\nshall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And\\nit would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the\\nanswer.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHow if I answer no?\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nSir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the\\nbreathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman\\nwilling, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if\\nnot, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nShall I re-deliver you e’en so?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nYours, yours.\\n\\n[_Exit Osric._]\\n\\nHe does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s\\nturn.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nHe did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many\\nmore of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got\\nthe tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty\\ncollection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and\\nwinnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are\\nout,\\n\\nEnter a Lord.\\n\\nLORD.\\nMy lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings\\nback to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your\\npleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his\\nfitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able\\nas now.\\n\\nLORD.\\nThe King and Queen and all are coming down.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIn happy time.\\n\\nLORD.\\nThe Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes\\nbefore you fall to play.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nShe well instructs me.\\n\\n[_Exit Lord._]\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual\\npractice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill\\nall’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nNay, good my lord.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would\\nperhaps trouble a woman.\\n\\nHORATIO.\\nIf your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair\\nhither, and say you are not fit.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNot a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of\\na sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it\\nwill be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all.\\nSince no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?\\n\\nEnter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.\\n\\nKING.\\nCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\\n\\n[_The King puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s._]\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nGive me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;\\nBut pardon’t as you are a gentleman.\\nThis presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\\nHow I am punish’d with sore distraction.\\nWhat I have done\\nThat might your nature, honour, and exception\\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\\nWas’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.\\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,\\nAnd when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,\\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\\nWho does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,\\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;\\nHis madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.\\nSir, in this audience,\\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil\\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\\nThat I have shot my arrow o’er the house\\nAnd hurt my brother.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nI am satisfied in nature,\\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\\nTo my revenge. But in my terms of honour\\nI stand aloof, and will no reconcilement\\nTill by some elder masters of known honour\\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\\nTo keep my name ungor’d. But till that time\\nI do receive your offer’d love like love,\\nAnd will not wrong it.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI embrace it freely,\\nAnd will this brother’s wager frankly play.—\\nGive us the foils; come on.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nCome, one for me.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nI’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\\nYour skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night,\\nStick fiery off indeed.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nYou mock me, sir.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nNo, by this hand.\\n\\nKING.\\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\\nYou know the wager?\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nVery well, my lord.\\nYour Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.\\n\\nKING.\\nI do not fear it. I have seen you both;\\nBut since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.\\n\\nLAERTES.\\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\\n\\nHAMLET.\\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\\n\\n[_They prepare to play._]\\n\\nOSRIC.\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nKING.\\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.\\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire;\\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,\\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw\\nRicher than that which four successive kings\\nIn Denmark’s crown have worn.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.

Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

When I\\nburned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air,\\ninto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came\\nmissives from the King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which\\ntitle, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the\\ncoming on of time, with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought\\ngood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou\\nmight’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what\\ngreatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”\\n\\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\\nWhat thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;\\nIt is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness\\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;\\nArt not without ambition, but without\\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,\\nThat which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;\\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\\nTo have thee crown’d withal.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nWhat is your tidings?\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThe King comes here tonight.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nThou’rt mad to say it.\\nIs not thy master with him? who, were’t so,\\nWould have inform’d for preparation.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nSo please you, it is true.

Come to my woman’s breasts,\\nAnd take my milk for gall, your murd’ring ministers,\\nWherever in your sightless substances\\nYou wait on nature’s mischief! Come, thick night,\\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell\\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\\nTo cry, “Hold, hold!”\\n\\n Enter Macbeth.\\n\\nGreat Glamis, worthy Cawdor!\\nGreater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\\nThy letters have transported me beyond\\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\\nThe future in the instant.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nMy dearest love,\\nDuncan comes here tonight.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nAnd when goes hence?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nTomorrow, as he purposes.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nO, never\\nShall sun that morrow see!\\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\\nMay read strange matters.

Hath it slept since?\\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\\nSuch I account thy love.

Wouldst thou have that\\nWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of life,\\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\\nLetting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”\\nLike the poor cat i’ th’ adage?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nPr’ythee, peace!\\nI dare do all that may become a man;\\nWho dares do more is none.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWhat beast was’t, then,\\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\\nHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:\\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\\nHave pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums\\nAnd dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you\\nHave done to this.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIf we should fail?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWe fail?\\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\\nAnd we’ll not fail.

I am afraid they have awak’d,\\nAnd ’tis not done.

Who’s there, i’\\nth’ other devil’s name?

[_Knocking._]\\nKnock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold\\nfor hell.

Lechery, sir, it provokes\\nand unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the\\nperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with\\nlechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes\\nhim off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him\\nthe lie, leaves him.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\\n\\nPORTER.\\nThat it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his\\nlie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs\\nsometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nIs thy master stirring?\\n\\n Enter Macbeth.\\n\\nOur knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nGood morrow, noble sir!\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGood morrow, both!\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nNot yet.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\\nI have almost slipp’d the hour.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll bring you to him.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you;\\nBut yet ’tis one.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThe labour we delight in physics pain.\\nThis is the door.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI’ll make so bold to call.\\nFor ’tis my limited service.\\n\\n [_Exit Macduff._]\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nGoes the King hence today?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHe does. He did appoint so.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nThe night has been unruly: where we lay,\\nOur chimneys were blown down and, as they say,\\nLamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death,\\nAnd prophesying, with accents terrible,\\nOf dire combustion and confus’d events,\\nNew hatch’d to the woeful time.

No man:\\nTh’ expedition of my violent love\\nOutrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\\nHis silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;\\nAnd his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature\\nFor ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\\nSteep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers\\nUnmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain,\\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\\nCourage to make’s love known?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nHelp me hence, ho!\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nLook to the lady.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWhy do we hold our tongues,\\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\\n\\nDONALBAIN.\\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\\nHid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us?\\nLet’s away.

There is none but he\\nWhose being I do fear: and under him\\nMy genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said,\\nMark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\\nAnd bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like,\\nThey hail’d him father to a line of kings:\\nUpon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,\\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\\nThence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,\\nNo son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,\\nFor Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;\\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;\\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\\nRather than so, come, fate, into the list,\\nAnd champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—\\n\\n Enter Servant with two Murderers.\\n\\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\\n\\n [_Exit Servant._]\\n\\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nIt was, so please your Highness.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWell then, now\\nHave you consider’d of my speeches? Know\\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\\nOur innocent self? This I made good to you\\nIn our last conference, pass’d in probation with you\\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,\\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might\\nTo half a soul and to a notion craz’d\\nSay, “Thus did Banquo.”\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nYou made it known to us.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI did so; and went further, which is now\\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\\nYour patience so predominant in your nature,\\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,\\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\\nWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,\\nAnd beggar’d yours forever?\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nWe are men, my liege.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;\\nAs hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\\nAll by the name of dogs: the valu’d file\\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\\nHath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive\\nParticular addition, from the bill\\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\\nNot i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t;\\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\\nWhich in his death were perfect.\\n\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\nI am one, my liege,\\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\\nHath so incens’d that I am reckless what\\nI do to spite the world.\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nAnd I another,\\nSo weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,\\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\\nTo mend it or be rid on’t.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBoth of you\\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\\n\\nBOTH MURDERERS.\\nTrue, my lord.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\\nAgainst my near’st of life; and though I could\\nWith barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,\\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\\nWho I myself struck down: and thence it is\\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\\nMasking the business from the common eye\\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\\n\\nSECOND MURDERER.\\nWe shall, my lord,\\nPerform what you command us.\\n\\nFIRST MURDERER.\\nThough our lives—\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most,\\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,\\nThe moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight\\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\\nWhose absence is no less material to me\\nThan is his father’s, must embrace the fate\\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\\nI’ll come to you anon.\\n\\nBOTH MURDERERS.\\nWe are resolv’d, my lord.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll call upon you straight: abide within.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Murderers._]\\n\\nIt is concluded.

Things without all remedy\\nShould be without regard: what’s done is done.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWe have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it.\\nShe’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice\\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\\nBut let the frame of things disjoint,\\nBoth the worlds suffer,\\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\\nAfter life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;\\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\\nCan touch him further.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nCome on,\\nGently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks;\\nBe bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.\\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\\nUnsafe the while, that we\\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\\nDisguising what they are.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nYou must leave this.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\\nThou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nBut in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThere’s comfort yet; they are assailable.\\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\\nHis cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons\\nThe shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,\\nHath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done\\nA deed of dreadful note.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWhat’s to be done?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\\nWhich keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow\\nMakes wing to th’ rooky wood.\\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\\nWhiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.\\nThou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;\\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\\nSo, pr’ythee, go with me.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE III.

There’s blood upon thy face.\\n\\nMURDERER.\\n’Tis Banquo’s then.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\n’Tis better thee without than he within.\\nIs he dispatch’d?\\n\\nMURDERER.\\nMy lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;\\nYet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:\\nIf thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.\\n\\nMURDERER.\\nMost royal sir,\\nFleance is ’scap’d.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThen comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;\\nWhole as the marble, founded as the rock,\\nAs broad and general as the casing air:\\nBut now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in\\nTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?\\n\\nMURDERER.\\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\\nThe least a death to nature.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThanks for that.\\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled\\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\\nNo teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow\\nWe’ll hear, ourselves, again.\\n\\n [_Exit Murderer._]\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nMy royal lord,\\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\\nThat is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,\\n’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;\\nFrom thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;\\nMeeting were bare without it.\\n\\n The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nSweet remembrancer!—\\nNow, good digestion wait on appetite,\\nAnd health on both!\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nMay’t please your Highness sit.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHere had we now our country’s honour roof’d,\\nWere the grac’d person of our Banquo present;\\nWho may I rather challenge for unkindness\\nThan pity for mischance!\\n\\nROSS.\\nHis absence, sir,\\nLays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness\\nTo grace us with your royal company?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThe table’s full.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nHere is a place reserv’d, sir.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWhere?\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nHere, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWhich of you have done this?\\n\\nLORDS.\\nWhat, my good lord?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThou canst not say I did it. Never shake\\nThy gory locks at me.\\n\\nROSS.\\nGentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nSit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,\\nAnd hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;\\nThe fit is momentary; upon a thought\\nHe will again be well. If much you note him,\\nYou shall offend him, and extend his passion.\\nFeed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nAy, and a bold one, that dare look on that\\nWhich might appal the devil.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nO proper stuff!\\nThis is the very painting of your fear:\\nThis is the air-drawn dagger which you said,\\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts\\n(Impostors to true fear), would well become\\nA woman’s story at a winter’s fire,\\nAuthoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all’s done,\\nYou look but on a stool.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nPr’ythee, see there!\\nBehold! look! lo! how say you?\\nWhy, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.—\\nIf charnel houses and our graves must send\\nThose that we bury back, our monuments\\nShall be the maws of kites.\\n\\n [_Ghost disappears._]\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWhat, quite unmann’d in folly?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIf I stand here, I saw him.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nFie, for shame!\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBlood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,\\nEre humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;\\nAy, and since too, murders have been perform’d\\nToo terrible for the ear: the time has been,\\nThat, when the brains were out, the man would die,\\nAnd there an end; but now they rise again,\\nWith twenty mortal murders on their crowns,\\nAnd push us from our stools. This is more strange\\nThan such a murder is.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nMy worthy lord,\\nYour noble friends do lack you.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI do forget.—\\nDo not muse at me, my most worthy friends.\\nI have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\\nTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all;\\nThen I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.—\\nI drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table,\\nAnd to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss:\\nWould he were here.\\n\\n Ghost rises again.\\n\\nTo all, and him, we thirst,\\nAnd all to all.\\n\\nLORDS.\\nOur duties, and the pledge.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nAvaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\\nThy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\\nWhich thou dost glare with!\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nThink of this, good peers,\\nBut as a thing of custom: ’tis no other,\\nOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWhat man dare, I dare:\\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\\nThe arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger;\\nTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\\nShall never tremble: or be alive again,\\nAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword;\\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest me\\nThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\\nUnreal mock’ry, hence!\\n\\n [_Ghost disappears._]\\n\\nWhy, so;—being gone,\\nI am a man again.—Pray you, sit still.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nYou have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting\\nWith most admir’d disorder.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nCan such things be,\\nAnd overcome us like a summer’s cloud,\\nWithout our special wonder? You make me strange\\nEven to the disposition that I owe,\\nWhen now I think you can behold such sights,\\nAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,\\nWhen mine are blanch’d with fear.\\n\\nROSS.\\nWhat sights, my lord?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nI pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\\nQuestion enrages him. At once, good night:—\\nStand not upon the order of your going,\\nBut go at once.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nGood night; and better health\\nAttend his Majesty!\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nA kind good night to all!\\n\\n [_Exeunt all Lords and Attendants._]\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIt will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.\\nStones have been known to move, and trees to speak;\\nAugurs, and understood relations, have\\nBy magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth\\nThe secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nAlmost at odds with morning, which is which.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHow say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person\\nAt our great bidding?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nDid you send to him, sir?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI hear it by the way; but I will send.\\nThere’s not a one of them but in his house\\nI keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow\\n(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:\\nMore shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\\nBy the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,\\nAll causes shall give way: I am in blood\\nStepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,\\nReturning were as tedious as go o’er.\\nStrange things I have in head, that will to hand,\\nWhich must be acted ere they may be scann’d.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nYou lack the season of all natures, sleep.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nCome, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse\\nIs the initiate fear that wants hard use.\\nWe are yet but young in deed.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE V. The heath.\\n\\n Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.\\n\\nFIRST WITCH.\\nWhy, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.\\n\\nHECATE.\\nHave I not reason, beldams as you are,\\nSaucy and overbold? How did you dare\\nTo trade and traffic with Macbeth\\nIn riddles and affairs of death;\\nAnd I, the mistress of your charms,\\nThe close contriver of all harms,\\nWas never call’d to bear my part,\\nOr show the glory of our art?\\nAnd, which is worse, all you have done\\nHath been but for a wayward son,\\nSpiteful and wrathful; who, as others do,\\nLoves for his own ends, not for you.\\nBut make amends now: get you gone,\\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\\nMeet me i’ th’ morning: thither he\\nWill come to know his destiny.\\nYour vessels and your spells provide,\\nYour charms, and everything beside.\\nI am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend\\nUnto a dismal and a fatal end.\\nGreat business must be wrought ere noon.\\nUpon the corner of the moon\\nThere hangs a vap’rous drop profound;\\nI’ll catch it ere it come to ground:\\nAnd that, distill’d by magic sleights,\\nShall raise such artificial sprites,\\nAs, by the strength of their illusion,\\nShall draw him on to his confusion.\\nHe shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\\nHis hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear.\\nAnd you all know, security\\nIs mortals’ chiefest enemy.\\n\\n [_Music and song within, “Come away, come away” &c._]\\n\\nHark! I am call’d; my little spirit, see,\\nSits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nFIRST WITCH.\\nCome, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.\\n\\n Enter Lennox and another Lord.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\\nWhich can interpret farther: only, I say,\\nThing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\nWas pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;\\nWhom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,\\nFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\\nTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!\\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,\\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents tear\\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;\\nFor ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,\\nTo hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,\\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think,\\nThat had he Duncan’s sons under his key\\n(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find\\nWhat ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\\nBut, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d\\nHis presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,\\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\\nWhere he bestows himself?\\n\\nLORD.\\nThe son of Duncan,\\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\\nLives in the English court and is receiv’d\\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward\\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\\nTo ratify the work), we may again\\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;\\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honours,\\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\\nHath so exasperate the King that he\\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nSent he to Macduff?\\n\\nLORD.\\nHe did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”\\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back,\\nAnd hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time\\nThat clogs me with this answer.”\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nAnd that well might\\nAdvise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance\\nHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\\nFly to the court of England, and unfold\\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\\nUnder a hand accurs’d!\\n\\nLORD.\\nI’ll send my prayers with him.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT IV\\n\\nSCENE I.

You may be rightly just,\\nWhatever I shall think.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nBleed, bleed, poor country!\\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;\\nThe title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord:\\nI would not be the villain that thou think’st\\nFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp\\nAnd the rich East to boot.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBe not offended:\\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I think, withal,\\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\\nAnd here, from gracious England, have I offer\\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,\\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\\nShall have more vices than it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\\nBy him that shall succeed.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nWhat should he be?\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nIt is myself I mean; in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\\nThat, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth\\nWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor state\\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compar’d\\nWith my confineless harms.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nNot in the legions\\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d\\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nI grant him bloody,\\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\\nThat has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,\\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\\nThe cistern of my lust; and my desire\\nAll continent impediments would o’erbear,\\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\\nThan such an one to reign.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nBoundless intemperance\\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\\nTh’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,\\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\nAnd yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.\\nWe have willing dames enough; there cannot be\\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\\nFinding it so inclin’d.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWith this there grows\\nIn my most ill-compos’d affection such\\nA staunchless avarice, that, were I king,\\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands;\\nDesire his jewels, and this other’s house:\\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\\nDestroying them for wealth.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nThis avarice\\nSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root\\nThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath been\\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will,\\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\\nWith other graces weigh’d.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,\\nAs justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,\\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\\nI have no relish of them; but abound\\nIn the division of each several crime,\\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\\nUproar the universal peace, confound\\nAll unity on earth.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nO Scotland, Scotland!\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:\\nI am as I have spoken.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nFit to govern?\\nNo, not to live.—O nation miserable,\\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\\nBy his own interdiction stands accus’d,\\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\\nOft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,\\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\\nThese evils thou repeat’st upon thyself\\nHave banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,\\nThy hope ends here!\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nMacduff, this noble passion,\\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\\nWiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts\\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\\nDeal between thee and me! for even now\\nI put myself to thy direction, and\\nUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\\nUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;\\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own;\\nAt no time broke my faith; would not betray\\nThe devil to his fellow; and delight\\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly,\\nIs thine and my poor country’s to command:\\nWhither, indeed, before thy here-approach,\\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\\nNow we’ll together, and the chance of goodness\\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\\n’Tis hard to reconcile.\\n\\n Enter a Doctor.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWell; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch,\\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\\nThey presently amend.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nI thank you, doctor.\\n\\n [_Exit Doctor._]\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nWhat’s the disease he means?\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\n’Tis call’d the evil:\\nA most miraculous work in this good king;\\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\\nHimself best knows, but strangely-visited people,\\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures;\\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\\nPut on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,\\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;\\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\\nThat speak him full of grace.\\n\\n Enter Ross.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nSee, who comes here?\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nMy countryman; but yet I know him not.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nI know him now. Good God, betimes remove\\nThe means that makes us strangers!\\n\\nROSS.\\nSir, amen.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nStands Scotland where it did?\\n\\nROSS.\\nAlas, poor country,\\nAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannot\\nBe call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,\\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\\nWhere sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,\\nAre made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems\\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell\\nIs there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives\\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\\nDying or ere they sicken.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nO, relation\\nToo nice, and yet too true!\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nWhat’s the newest grief?\\n\\nROSS.\\nThat of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;\\nEach minute teems a new one.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nHow does my wife?\\n\\nROSS.\\nWhy, well.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nAnd all my children?\\n\\nROSS.\\nWell too.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nThe tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?\\n\\nROSS.\\nNo; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nBe not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?\\n\\nROSS.\\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,\\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\\nWhich was to my belief witness’d the rather,\\nFor that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.\\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\\nTo doff their dire distresses.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBe’t their comfort\\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\\nAn older and a better soldier none\\nThat Christendom gives out.\\n\\nROSS.\\nWould I could answer\\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\\nThat would be howl’d out in the desert air,\\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nWhat concern they?\\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\\nDue to some single breast?\\n\\nROSS.\\nNo mind that’s honest\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\\nPertains to you alone.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nIf it be mine,\\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\\n\\nROSS.\\nLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\\nThat ever yet they heard.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nHumh! I guess at it.\\n\\nROSS.\\nYour castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes\\nSavagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner\\nWere, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,\\nTo add the death of you.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nMerciful heaven!—\\nWhat, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.\\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\\nWhispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nMy children too?\\n\\nROSS.\\nWife, children, servants, all\\nThat could be found.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nAnd I must be from thence!\\nMy wife kill’d too?\\n\\nROSS.\\nI have said.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBe comforted:\\nLet’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,\\nTo cure this deadly grief.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nHe has no children.—All my pretty ones?\\nDid you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?\\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\\nAt one fell swoop?\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nDispute it like a man.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nI shall do so;\\nBut I must also feel it as a man:\\nI cannot but remember such things were,\\nThat were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,\\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\\nFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\\n\\nMACDUFF.\\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\\nAnd braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,\\nCut short all intermission; front to front,\\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\\nWithin my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,\\nHeaven forgive him too!\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nThis tune goes manly.\\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\\nPut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;\\nThe night is long that never finds the day.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT V\\n\\nSCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.\\n\\n\\n Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nI have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your\\nreport. When was it she last walked?\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nSince his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her\\nbed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,\\nfold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to\\nbed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nA great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of\\nsleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation,\\nbesides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time,\\nhave you heard her say?\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nThat, sir, which I will not report after her.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nYou may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nNeither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.\\n\\n Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.\\n\\nLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast\\nasleep. Observe her; stand close.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nHow came she by that light?\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nWhy, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her\\ncommand.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nYou see, her eyes are open.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nAy, but their sense are shut.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nWhat is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nIt is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I\\nhave known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nYet here’s a spot.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nHark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my\\nremembrance the more strongly.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nOut, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t.\\nHell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\\nfear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who\\nwould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nDo you mark that?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nThe Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands\\nne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all\\nwith this starting.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nGo to, go to. You have known what you should not.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nShe has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what\\nshe has known.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nHere’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will\\nnot sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nWhat a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nI would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole\\nbody.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nWell, well, well.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nPray God it be, sir.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nThis disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have\\nwalked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nWash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you\\nyet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nEven so?\\n\\nLADY MACBETH.\\nTo bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,\\ngive me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to\\nbed.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nWill she go now to bed?\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nDirectly.\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nFoul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\\nDo breed unnatural troubles: infected minds\\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.—\\nGod, God, forgive us all! Look after her;\\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance,\\nAnd still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:\\nMy mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight.\\nI think, but dare not speak.\\n\\nGENTLEWOMAN.\\nGood night, good doctor.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.\\n\\n Enter, with drum and colours Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox and\\n Soldiers.\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nThe English power is near, led on by Malcolm,\\nHis uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.\\nRevenges burn in them; for their dear causes\\nWould to the bleeding and the grim alarm\\nExcite the mortified man.\\n\\nANGUS.\\nNear Birnam wood\\nShall we well meet them. That way are they coming.\\n\\nCAITHNESS.\\nWho knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nFor certain, sir, he is not. I have a file\\nOf all the gentry: there is Siward’s son\\nAnd many unrough youths, that even now\\nProtest their first of manhood.\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nWhat does the tyrant?\\n\\nCAITHNESS.\\nGreat Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.\\nSome say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,\\nDo call it valiant fury: but, for certain,\\nHe cannot buckle his distemper’d cause\\nWithin the belt of rule.\\n\\nANGUS.\\nNow does he feel\\nHis secret murders sticking on his hands;\\nNow minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\\nThose he commands move only in command,\\nNothing in love: now does he feel his title\\nHang loose about him, like a giant’s robe\\nUpon a dwarfish thief.\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nWho, then, shall blame\\nHis pester’d senses to recoil and start,\\nWhen all that is within him does condemn\\nItself for being there?\\n\\nCAITHNESS.\\nWell, march we on,\\nTo give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d:\\nMeet we the med’cine of the sickly weal;\\nAnd with him pour we, in our country’s purge,\\nEach drop of us.\\n\\nLENNOX.\\nOr so much as it needs\\nTo dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.\\nMake we our march towards Birnam.\\n\\n [_Exeunt, marching._]\\n\\nSCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.\\n\\n Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBring me no more reports; let them fly all:\\nTill Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane\\nI cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?\\nWas he not born of woman? The spirits that know\\nAll mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:\\n“Fear not, Macbeth; no man that’s born of woman\\nShall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly, false thanes,\\nAnd mingle with the English epicures:\\nThe mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,\\nShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\\n\\n Enter a Servant.\\n\\nThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!\\nWhere gott’st thou that goose look?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nThere is ten thousand—\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGeese, villain?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nSoldiers, sir.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nGo prick thy face and over-red thy fear,\\nThou lily-liver’d boy. What soldiers, patch?\\nDeath of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine\\nAre counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nThe English force, so please you.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nTake thy face hence.\\n\\n [_Exit Servant._]\\n\\nSeyton!—I am sick at heart,\\nWhen I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push\\nWill cheer me ever or disseat me now.\\nI have liv’d long enough: my way of life\\nIs fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf;\\nAnd that which should accompany old age,\\nAs honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,\\nI must not look to have; but, in their stead,\\nCurses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,\\nWhich the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.\\nSeyton!—\\n\\n Enter Seyton.\\n\\nSEYTON.\\nWhat’s your gracious pleasure?\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWhat news more?\\n\\nSEYTON.\\nAll is confirm’d, my lord, which was reported.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack’d.\\nGive me my armour.\\n\\nSEYTON.\\n’Tis not needed yet.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI’ll put it on.\\nSend out more horses, skirr the country round;\\nHang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.—\\nHow does your patient, doctor?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nNot so sick, my lord,\\nAs she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,\\nThat keep her from her rest.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nCure her of that:\\nCanst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,\\nPluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\\nRaze out the written troubles of the brain,\\nAnd with some sweet oblivious antidote\\nCleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff\\nWhich weighs upon the heart?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nTherein the patient\\nMust minister to himself.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nThrow physic to the dogs, I’ll none of it.\\nCome, put mine armour on; give me my staff:\\nSeyton, send out.—Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.—\\nCome, sir, despatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast\\nThe water of my land, find her disease,\\nAnd purge it to a sound and pristine health,\\nI would applaud thee to the very echo,\\nThat should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.—\\nWhat rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,\\nWould scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nAy, my good lord. Your royal preparation\\nMakes us hear something.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nBring it after me.—\\nI will not be afraid of death and bane,\\nTill Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.\\n\\n [_Exeunt all except Doctor._]\\n\\nDOCTOR.\\nWere I from Dunsinane away and clear,\\nProfit again should hardly draw me here.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nSCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.\\n\\n Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff,\\n Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nCousins, I hope the days are near at hand\\nThat chambers will be safe.\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nWe doubt it nothing.\\n\\nSIWARD.\\nWhat wood is this before us?\\n\\nMENTEITH.\\nThe wood of Birnam.\\n\\nMALCOLM.\\nLet every soldier hew him down a bough,\\nAnd bear’t before him.

Dunsinane. Within the castle.\\n\\n Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nHang out our banners on the outward walls;\\nThe cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength\\nWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie\\nTill famine and the ague eat them up.\\nWere they not forc’d with those that should be ours,\\nWe might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\\nAnd beat them backward home.\\n\\n [_A cry of women within._]\\n\\nWhat is that noise?\\n\\nSEYTON.\\nIt is the cry of women, my good lord.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nI have almost forgot the taste of fears.\\nThe time has been, my senses would have cool’d\\nTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair\\nWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\\nAs life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;\\nDireness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\\nCannot once start me.\\n\\n Enter Seyton.\\n\\nWherefore was that cry?\\n\\nSEYTON.\\nThe Queen, my lord, is dead.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nShe should have died hereafter.\\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\\nLife’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,\\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\\nSignifying nothing.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nThou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nGracious my lord,\\nI should report that which I say I saw,\\nBut know not how to do’t.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nWell, say, sir.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nAs I did stand my watch upon the hill,\\nI look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\\nThe wood began to move.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nLiar, and slave!\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nLet me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.\\nWithin this three mile may you see it coming;\\nI say, a moving grove.\\n\\nMACBETH.\\nIf thou speak’st false,\\nUpon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\\nTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.—\\nI pull in resolution; and begin\\nTo doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,\\nThat lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood\\nDo come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood\\nComes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—\\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\\nI ’gin to be aweary of the sun,\\nAnd wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—\\nRing the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!\\nAt least we’ll die with harness on our back.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE VI.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.

Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nStop there, stop there.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\\nlonger.\\n\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nHere’s goodly gear!\\nA sail, a sail!\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nPeter!\\n\\nPETER.\\nAnon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nMy fan, Peter.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIs it good-den?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\\nprick of noon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\\nfault of a worse.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYou say well.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nShe will endite him to some supper.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat hast thou found?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\\n[_Sings._]\\n    An old hare hoar,\\n    And an old hare hoar,\\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\\n    But a hare that is hoar\\n    Is too much for a score\\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI will follow you.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\n\\nNURSE.\\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\\nropery?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\\nuse me at his pleasure!\\n\\nPETER.\\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\\nvery weak dealing.\\n\\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\\nthee,—\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\\nbe a joyful woman.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\\ngentlemanlike offer.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nBid her devise\\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGo to; I say you shall.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nCommend me to thy lady.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\\n\\n [_Exit Romeo._]\\n\\nPETER.\\nAnon.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nBefore and apace.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\\n\\n Enter Juliet.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\\nAnd his to me.\\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\\n\\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\\n\\nO God, she comes.

Do you not see that I am\\nout of breath?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nWhere is my mother?

Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\\n\\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\\n\\n Enter Juliet.\\n\\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\\n\\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\nSCENE I. A public Place.\\n\\n\\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAm I like such a fellow?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAnd what to?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\\ntutor me from quarrelling!\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThe fee simple! O simple!\\n\\n Enter Tybalt and others.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nBy my heel, I care not.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\\nword and a blow.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\\noccasion.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\\n\\n Enter Romeo.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\\n\\nTYBALT.\\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\\n\\nTYBALT.\\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nCome, sir, your passado.\\n\\n [_They fight._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\\nHold, Tybalt!

Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\\n\\n [_Exit Page._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\\narm.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI thought all for the best.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\\n\\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\\n\\nROMEO.\\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\\nHath been my cousin.

Prince, as thou art true,\\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\\nO cousin, cousin.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\\nThe life of Tybalt.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nAnd for that offence\\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE II.

Therefore hence, be gone.\\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nSo shalt thou show me friendship.

I think\\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\\nTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.\\nI’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\\nA grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,\\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.\\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.\\n\\n [_Laying Paris in the monument._]\\n\\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\\nHave they been merry! Which their keepers call\\nA lightning before death. O, how may I\\nCall this a lightning? O my love, my wife,\\nDeath that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,\\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\\nThou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet\\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\\nHere’s to my love!

Then comes she to me,\\nAnd with wild looks, bid me devise some means\\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\\nTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,\\nBeing the time the potion’s force should cease.\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\\nWas stay’d by accident; and yesternight\\nReturn’d my letter back. Then all alone\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\\nCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\\nBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,\\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\\nWhere’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?\\n\\nBALTHASAR.\\nI brought my master news of Juliet’s death,\\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\\nAnd threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,\\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\\nWhere is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?\\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\nPAGE.\\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,\\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nThis letter doth make good the Friar’s words,\\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\\nOf a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal\\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\\nThis is my daughter’s jointure, for no more\\nCan I demand.\\n\\nMONTAGUE.\\nBut I can give thee more,\\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\nCAPULET.\\nAs rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,\\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\\n\\nPRINCE.\\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things.\\nSome shall be pardon’d, and some punished,\\nFor never was a story of more woe\\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Her mother had\\ndied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\\nof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\\nas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\\n\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a\\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even\\nbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\\nthe mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\\nrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\\nhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\\nand Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s\\njudgment, but directed chiefly by her own.\\n\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so\\nunperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\\nher.\\n\\nSorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor’s\\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father\\nand herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to\\ncheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after\\ndinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she\\nhad lost.\\n\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was\\na man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\\nwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. The want\\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\\npast kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had\\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had\\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed\\nher through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\\nthe equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\\nIsabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\\nhers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\\n\\nHow was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going\\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\\nMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\\ndomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\\nsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\\nHe could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\\n\\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\\nor body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\\n\\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\\nand give her pleasant society again.\\n\\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\\neven half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\\nsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\\nand made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He\\nwas a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\\nused to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\\nMatrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\\nby no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could\\never speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\\nmatch of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\\ntoo; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\\nto suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\\nwas very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for\\nherself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\\nhad spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and\\nchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\\nwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\\nsaid at dinner,\\n\\n“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!”\\n\\n“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\\ngood-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a\\ngood wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\\nown?”\\n\\n“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\nThis is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my\\ndear.”\\n\\n“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We\\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\\nvisit very soon.”\\n\\n“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\\nnot walk half so far.”\\n\\n“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.”\\n\\n“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\\nlittle way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\\nvisit?”\\n\\n“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have\\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\\nto Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only\\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\\nmentioned her—James is so obliged to you!”\\n\\n“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\\nbe able to tell her how we all are.”\\n\\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\\nthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived\\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\\nsome days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\\nWoodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and\\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\\nhave had a shocking walk.”\\n\\n“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\\nmust draw back from your great fire.”\\n\\n“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\\ncatch cold.”\\n\\n“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”\\n\\n“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”\\n\\n“By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\\nall behave? Who cried most?”\\n\\n“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ’Tis a sad business.”\\n\\n“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\\n‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it\\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.”\\n\\n“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\\ncreature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I\\nknow—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”\\n\\n“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with\\na sigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”\\n\\n“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a\\njoke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\\nwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\\nevery body.\\n\\n“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no\\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\\na gainer.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about the\\nwedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\\nnot a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\\nwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\\nevery day.”\\n\\n“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.\\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”\\n\\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It is\\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\\nKnightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s\\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s\\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.”\\n\\n“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a\\nvery considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match,\\nyou know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\\nmay comfort me for any thing.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah! my\\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\\nmatches.”\\n\\n“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\\nsuccess, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend\\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\\n\\n“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met\\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\\nFarmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\\nmatch-making.”\\n\\n“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley.\\n“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But\\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\\nmeans only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I\\nthink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\\nto marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then\\nafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\\nyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\\nsaid.”\\n\\n“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I\\npity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\\nword ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\\nbut I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and\\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given\\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\\nenough to comprehend that.”\\n\\n“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\\ngood to them, by interference.”\\n\\n“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined\\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not\\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family\\ncircle grievously.”\\n\\n“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\\nElton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\\nHighbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has\\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\\nhim single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands\\nto-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\\nkind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\\nthe only way I have of doing him a service.”\\n\\n“Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good\\nyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew\\nhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.\\nThat will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so\\nkind as to meet him.”\\n\\n“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley,\\nlaughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by\\nentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\\n\\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great\\nYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\\nsurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\\nwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would\\noffend.\\n\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\\nfortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was\\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off\\nwith due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce\\nmuch happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had\\na husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing\\ndue to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but\\nnot enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s\\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\\n\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he\\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\\nmother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\\ncreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\\nof the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some\\nreluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\\nwere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\\ncare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\\nto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\\n\\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\\noccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\\nyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\\nrealised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little\\nestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to\\nmarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according\\nto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.\\n\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\\nhad not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\\n\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\\nuncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,\\ntherefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance. His father\\nhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and\\ngoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston’s nature to\\nimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,\\nand, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in\\nLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\\nlooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\\nprospects a kind of common concern.\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\\n\\nNow, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not\\na dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea\\nwith Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the\\nvisit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and\\nthe hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his\\nnew mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in\\nHighbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had\\nreceived. “I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank\\nChurchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very\\nhandsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw\\nthe letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his\\nlife.”\\n\\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\\n\\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\\npain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,\\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\\nhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance\\nof Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female\\nwalking, and in Mr. Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which would\\nmake the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the\\nevenings in the week together.\\n\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more\\nthan satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\\nat his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her\\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”\\n\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to\\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could\\nbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\\nunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\\nthem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\\nearnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it. He had been at the\\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\\nPerry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were\\none of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to,\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\\nmany—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\\n\\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own\\nlittle circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance\\nbut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,\\nHighbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in\\nthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many\\nsuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of the\\nchosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he\\npreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to\\ncompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could\\nnot make up a card-table for him.\\n\\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and\\nby Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\\nelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles\\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\\n\\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\\nwould have been a grievance.\\n\\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\\nevery body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to\\nevery body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\\ngossip.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or an\\nestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant\\nmorality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies\\nfor enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a\\nreal, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where\\ngirls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into\\na little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.\\nGoddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highbury\\nwas reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and\\ngarden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about\\na great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with\\nher own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now\\nwalked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,\\nwho had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to\\nthe occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to\\nMr. Woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her\\nneat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win\\nor lose a few sixpences by his fireside.\\n\\nThese were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\\ncollect; and happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power;\\nthough, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the\\nabsence of Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look\\ncomfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things\\nso well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that\\nevery evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had\\nfearfully anticipated.\\n\\nAs she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\\npresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\\nrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\\nwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\\nvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her\\nbeauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\\nlonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\\n\\nHarriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\\nher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard’s school, and somebody had\\nlately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\\nparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\\nShe had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\\nwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\\nladies who had been at school there with her.\\n\\nShe was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\\nfine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of\\ngreat sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much\\npleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to\\ncontinue the acquaintance.\\n\\nShe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith’s\\nconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not\\ninconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing,\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by\\nthe appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\\nbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\\nEncouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\\nnatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of\\nHighbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed\\nwere unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though\\nvery good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of\\nthe name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a\\nlarge farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very\\ncreditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\\nthem—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\\nintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and\\nelegance to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve\\nher; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her\\ninto good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It\\nwould be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly\\nbecoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\\n\\nShe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\\nlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\\nevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\\nalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\\nwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to\\nthe fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common\\nimpulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of\\ndoing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a\\nmind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of\\nthe meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped\\noysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the\\nearly hours and civil scruples of their guests.\\n\\nUpon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse’s feelings were in sad warfare.\\nHe loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\\nyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\\nrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality\\nwould have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their\\nhealth made him grieve that they would eat.\\n\\nSuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he\\ncould, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might\\nconstrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer\\nthings, to say:\\n\\n“Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\\nboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\\nbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\\nelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see—one of\\nour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\\n_little_ bit of tart—a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\\nneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\\ncustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\\n_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it\\ncould disagree with you.”\\n\\nEmma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much\\nmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\\npleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\\nquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\\nin Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\\npanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\\nhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which\\nMiss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken\\nhands with her at last!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHarriet Smith’s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\\nand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,\\nand telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance\\nincreased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking\\ncompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston’s loss had been important. Her father never\\nwent beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\\nhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\\nWeston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\\nventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\\nSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\\nwould be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\\nas she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\\nkind designs.\\n\\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\\nvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\\nof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith’s being exactly the\\nyoung friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required.\\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\\nthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.\\nWeston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\\n\\nHer first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\\nwas obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in\\nthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\\nhad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just\\nwhat Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\\n\\nMrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the\\nschool in general, formed naturally a great part of the\\nconversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\\nAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\\nher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with\\nthem, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\\ntalkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and\\nenjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of Mrs. Martin’s having “_two_ parlours, two very good\\nparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard’s\\ndrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\\nfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\\nthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\\ncow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin’s saying as she was so fond of it, it\\nshould be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\\nsummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\\ndrink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\\npeople.”\\n\\nFor some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\\ncause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\\narose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\\ndaughter, a son and son’s wife, who all lived together; but when it\\nappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\\nalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\\nsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\\nMartin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were\\nnot taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\\n\\nWith this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\\nmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\\nspeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\nevening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very\\ngood-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in\\norder to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was\\nof them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his\\nshepherd’s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.\\nShe was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She\\nbelieved he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very\\nfine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his\\nwool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well\\nof him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had\\ntold her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was\\nimpossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,\\nwhenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she\\n_wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.\\n\\n“Well done, Mrs. Martin!” thought Emma. “You know what you are about.”\\n\\n“And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\\nMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\\nseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\\nher.”\\n\\n“Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\\nhis own business? He does not read?”\\n\\n“Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good\\ndeal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\\nwindow seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\\ncan.”\\n\\nThe next question was—\\n\\n“What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?”\\n\\n“Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\\nKingston. He has passed you very often.”\\n\\n“That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.”\\n\\n“To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed\\nhim; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\\nhis age to be?”\\n\\n“He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\\n23rd just a fortnight and a day’s difference—which is very odd.”\\n\\n“Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\\nthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\\nmight be very desirable.”\\n\\n“Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!”\\n\\n“Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\\nentirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\\nany thing yet.”\\n\\n“To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\\nof taking a boy another year.”\\n\\n“I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\\nmarry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his\\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\\ncareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\\ngentleman’s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station\\nby every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people\\nwho would take pleasure in degrading you.”\\n\\n“Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\\nbody can do.”\\n\\n“You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you\\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to\\nhave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if\\nyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you\\nmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted\\nwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer’s daughter,\\nwithout education.”\\n\\n“To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However,\\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall\\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\\nvisit her, if I can help it.”\\n\\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,\\nbut she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no\\nserious difficulty, on Harriet’s side, to oppose any friendly\\narrangement of her own.\\n\\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\\nthought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet’s\\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\\nnoticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\\n\\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\\ncompose.\\n\\n“Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a\\nchance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot\\nit, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!\\nWell, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think\\nof him? Do you think him so very plain?”\\n\\n“He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing\\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\\ndegree or two nearer gentility.”\\n\\n“To be sure,” said Harriet, in a mortified voice, “he is not so genteel\\nas real gentlemen.”\\n\\n“I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\\ninferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\\nWere not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.”\\n\\n“Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air\\nand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.\\nBut Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!”\\n\\n“Mr. Knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\\ncompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being\\nsilent. You must see the difference.”\\n\\n“Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\\nman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.”\\n\\n“Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\\nWeston’s time of life?”\\n\\n“There is no saying, indeed,” replied Harriet rather solemnly.\\n\\n“But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\\nnothing but profit and loss.”\\n\\n“Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.”\\n\\n“How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelse—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\\nrich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\\n_us_.”\\n\\n“I wonder he did not remember the book”—was all Harriet’s answer, and\\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\\nnext beginning was,\\n\\n“In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton’s manners are superior to Mr.\\nKnightley’s or Mr. Weston’s. They have more gentleness. They might be\\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to\\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley’s downright, decided, commanding\\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to\\nset about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I\\nthink a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as\\na model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He\\nseems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to\\nplease you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?”\\n\\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from\\nMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,\\nand said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\\n\\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\\nfarmer out of Harriet’s head. She thought it would be an excellent\\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet’s coming to\\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of\\nits expediency. Mr. Elton’s situation was most suitable, quite the\\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\\n\\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet’s there could be little\\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned\\nvery handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\\nwith:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin’s riding\\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered\\nby Mr. Elton’s admiration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n“I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr.\\nKnightley, “of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but\\nI think it a bad thing.”\\n\\n“A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”\\n\\n“I think they will neither of them do the other any good.”\\n\\n“You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with\\na new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have\\nbeen seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very\\ndifferently we feel!—Not think they will do each other any good! This\\nwill certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\\nKnightley.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\\nWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”\\n\\n“Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he\\nthinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only\\nyesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there\\nshould be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr.\\nKnightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You\\nare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a\\ncompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a\\nwoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\\nit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is\\nnot the superior young woman which Emma’s friend ought to be. But on\\nthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an\\ninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She\\nmeans it, I know.”\\n\\n“Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years\\nold. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\\nof books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists\\nthey were—very well chosen, and very neatly arranged—sometimes\\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up\\nwhen only fourteen—I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring\\nindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.—You never could persuade her\\nto read half so much as you wished.—You know you could not.”\\n\\n“I dare say,” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “that I thought so\\n_then_;—but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma’s omitting\\nto do any thing I wished.”\\n\\n“There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,”—said\\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “But I,”\\nhe soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able\\nto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was\\nalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since\\nshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In\\nher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits\\nher mother’s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.”\\n\\n“I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse’s family and wanted another\\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, smiling. “You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself\\nto be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on\\nthe very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\\ndoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a\\nwife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.”\\n\\n“Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.”\\n\\n“Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\\nthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\\nWe will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness\\nof comfort, or his son may plague him.”\\n\\n“I hope not _that_.—It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter.”\\n\\n“Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma’s\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.—But\\nHarriet Smith—I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_\\ncannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of\\nconceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just\\nrefined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\\ncircumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma’s\\ndoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\\nadapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\\nlife.—They only give a little polish.”\\n\\n“I either depend more upon Emma’s good sense than you do, or am more\\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\\nHow well she looked last night!”\\n\\n“Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma’s being pretty.”\\n\\n“Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\\nbeauty than Emma altogether—face and figure?”\\n\\n“I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\\nold friend.”\\n\\n“Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features,\\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being ‘the picture of health;’\\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?”\\n\\n“I have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “I think her\\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”\\n\\n“And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma’s little faults, she is an\\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\\ntimes.”\\n\\n“Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and\\nIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind\\naffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not\\nquite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their\\nopinions with me.”\\n\\n“I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma’s\\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith’s intimacy being made a\\nmatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\\nsource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\\ngive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this\\nlittle remains of office.”\\n\\n“Not at all,” cried he; “I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\\ngood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\\nfound; for it shall be attended to.”\\n\\n“Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\\nher sister.”\\n\\n“Be satisfied,” said he, “I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\\nill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\\ndoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\\nperhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\\nfeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!”\\n\\n“So do I,” said Mrs. Weston gently, “very much.”\\n\\n“She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\\nnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\\ncared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\\nwith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\\ndoubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\\nto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.”\\n\\n“There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her\\nresolution at present,” said Mrs. Weston, “as can well be; and while\\nshe is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any\\nattachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr.\\nWoodhouse’s account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma,\\nthough I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.”\\n\\nPart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\\nand Mr. Weston’s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\\nat Randalls respecting Emma’s destiny, but it was not desirable to have\\nthem suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\\nafterwards made to “What does Weston think of the weather; shall we\\nhave rain?” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise\\nabout Hartfield.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet’s fancy a proper\\ndirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\\npurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\\nElton’s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\\nand as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\\nadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of\\ncreating as much liking on Harriet’s side, as there could be any\\noccasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton’s being in the\\nfairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no\\nscruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so\\nwarmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little\\ntime would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of\\nHarriet’s manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of\\nthe least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.\\n\\n“You have given Miss Smith all that she required,” said he; “you have\\nmade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she came\\nto you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\\ninfinitely superior to what she received from nature.”\\n\\n“I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\\ndrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\\nnatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\\ndone very little.”\\n\\n“If it were admissible to contradict a lady,” said the gallant Mr.\\nElton—\\n\\n“I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\\ntaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.”\\n\\n“Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\\ndecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!”\\n\\n“Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\\nmore truly amiable.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt of it.” And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\\nanimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\\nanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\\nto have Harriet’s picture.\\n\\n“Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?” said she: “did you\\never sit for your picture?”\\n\\nHarriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\\nwith a very interesting naïveté,\\n\\n“Oh! dear, no, never.”\\n\\nNo sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\\n\\n“What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\\ngive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\\nYou do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\\npassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\\nwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\\nanother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\\nif Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\\npicture!”\\n\\n“Let me entreat you,” cried Mr. Elton; “it would indeed be a delight!\\nLet me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in\\nfavour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you\\nsuppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\\nlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\\nfigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?”\\n\\nYes, good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking\\nlikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don’t pretend to be in\\nraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet’s face. “Well, if\\nyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\\nwhat I can do. Harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a\\nlikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\\neye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.”\\n\\n“Exactly so—The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth—I have\\nnot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.”\\n\\n“But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of\\nanswering me? How completely it meant, ‘why should my picture be\\ndrawn?’”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.”\\n\\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\\ndirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\\nattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\\nthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\\nbeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\\nalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\\nshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;—and drew in almost every\\nstyle; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she\\napproached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to\\ncommand, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as\\nto her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\\nunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\\naccomplishment often higher than it deserved.\\n\\nThere was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps the\\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\\nthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\\ncompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A\\nlikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse’s performances must be\\ncapital.\\n\\n“No great variety of faces for you,” said Emma. “I had only my own\\nfamily to study from. There is my father—another of my father—but the\\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and\\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her\\nfour children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry and\\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\\ncoarser featured than any of mama’s children ever were. Here is my\\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That’s\\nvery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\\nis very good. Then here is my last,”—unclosing a pretty sketch of a\\ngentleman in small size, whole-length—“my last and my best—my brother,\\nMr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I\\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\\ncould not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\\nreally made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite\\nagreed in thinking it _very_ like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but\\nthat was a fault on the right side”—after all this, came poor dear\\nIsabella’s cold approbation of—“Yes, it was a little like—but to be\\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\\npersuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then\\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet’s sake, or rather\\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.”\\n\\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and\\nwas repeating, “No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,” with so interesting a\\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\\n\\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley’s, and was\\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\\nstation over the mantelpiece.\\n\\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\\nto employ him in reading.\\n\\n“If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith’s.”\\n\\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\\nless would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\\nat the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the\\nprogress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an\\nencourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.\\n\\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\\npleased with the first day’s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\\ndestined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the\\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton’s very promising\\nattachment was likely to add.\\n\\nHarriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\\n\\n“By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\\nparty.”\\n\\nThe same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\\ntook place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\\npicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\\nbut Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\\ncriticism.\\n\\n“Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwanted,”—observed Mrs. Weston to him—not in the least suspecting that\\nshe was addressing a lover.—“The expression of the eye is most correct,\\nbut Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\\nher face that she has them not.”\\n\\n“Do you think so?” replied he. “I cannot agree with you. It appears to\\nme a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”\\n\\n“You have made her too tall, Emma,” said Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\\nadded,\\n\\n“Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,\\nshe is sitting down—which naturally presents a different—which in short\\ngives exactly the idea—and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\\nProportions, fore-shortening.—Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\\nsuch a height as Miss Smith’s. Exactly so indeed!”\\n\\n“It is very pretty,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “So prettily done! Just as\\nyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\\nwell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she\\nseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\\nshoulders—and it makes one think she must catch cold.”\\n\\n“But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\\nLook at the tree.”\\n\\n“But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.”\\n\\n“You, sir, may say any thing,” cried Mr. Elton, “but I must confess\\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\\nof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any\\nother situation would have been much less in character. The naïveté of\\nMiss Smith’s manners—and altogether—Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot\\nkeep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.”\\n\\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\\nfew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose\\ntaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all\\ncommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.\\nWoodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in\\nthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.\\nElton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.\\n“Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should\\nhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was\\nimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\\nsuch an errand.”\\n\\n“He was too good!—she could not endure the thought!—she would not give\\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,”—brought on the desired\\nrepetition of entreaties and assurances,—and a very few minutes settled\\nthe business.\\n\\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\\nnot being incommoded enough.\\n\\n“What a precious deposit!” said he with a tender sigh, as he received\\nit.\\n\\n“This man is almost too gallant to be in love,” thought Emma. “I should\\nsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\\nexactly; it will be an ‘Exactly so,’ as he says himself; but he does\\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet’s account.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThe very day of Mr. Elton’s going to London produced a fresh occasion\\nfor Emma’s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\\nas usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\\nreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked\\nof, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\\nminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\\nMrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\\nfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\\nlittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\\nopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs\\nwhich she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this\\nletter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal\\nof marriage. “Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did\\nnot know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good\\nletter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her\\nvery much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she\\ncould to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—” Emma was half-ashamed\\nof her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\\n\\n“Upon my word,” she cried, “the young man is determined not to lose any\\nthing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.”\\n\\n“Will you read the letter?” cried Harriet. “Pray do. II’d rather you\\nwould.”\\n\\nEmma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The\\nstyle of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not\\nmerely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have\\ndisgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and\\nunaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of\\nthe writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,\\nliberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,\\nwhile Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a “Well,\\nwell,” and was at last forced to add, “Is it a good letter? or is it\\ntoo short?”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, a very good letter,” replied Emma rather slowly—“so good\\na letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\\nsisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I\\nsaw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\\nleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\\nno, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\\nwoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\\ntalent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand,\\nhis thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,\\nI understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a\\ncertain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning\\nit,) than I had expected.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the still waiting Harriet;—“well—and—and what shall I do?”\\n\\n“What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\\nletter?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and\\nspeedily.”\\n\\n“Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.”\\n\\n“Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will\\nexpress yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your\\nnot being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\\nunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\\nconcern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\\npresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\\nnot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\\ndisappointment.”\\n\\n“You think I ought to refuse him then,” said Harriet, looking down.\\n\\n“Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\\ndoubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\\nunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you\\nfeel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you\\nwere consulting me only as to the wording of it.”\\n\\nHarriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\\n\\n“You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.”\\n\\n“No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you\\nadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to\\ndo.”\\n\\n“I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\\nwith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.”\\n\\n“I had no notion that he liked me so very much,” said Harriet,\\ncontemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\\nsilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\\nletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\\n\\n“I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\\nto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\\nrefuse him. If she can hesitate as to ‘Yes,’ she ought to say ‘No’\\ndirectly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\\nfeelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and\\nolder than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I\\nwant to influence you.”\\n\\n“Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would\\njust advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you\\nsay, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be\\nhesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say ‘No,’\\nperhaps.—Do you think I had better say ‘No?’”\\n\\n“Not for the world,” said Emma, smiling graciously, “would I advise you\\neither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\\nprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\\nagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\\nhesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this\\nmoment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\\nyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\\nmoment whom are you thinking of?”\\n\\nThe symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\\nconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\\nstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without\\nregard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong\\nhopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said—\\n\\n“Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as\\nwell as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really\\nalmost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?”\\n\\n“Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\\nwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\\nmyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\\nin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have\\ngrieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\\nconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\\ndegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not\\ninfluence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could\\nnot have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am\\nsecure of you for ever.”\\n\\nHarriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\\nforcibly.\\n\\n“You could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “No, to be\\nsure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\\nbeen too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\\ngive up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any\\nthing in the world.”\\n\\n“Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\\nmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\\nI must have given you up.”\\n\\n“Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\\nnever to come to Hartfield any more!”\\n\\n“Dear affectionate creature!—_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—_You_\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\\nwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\\nhave a pretty good opinion of himself.”\\n\\n“I do not think he is conceited either, in general,” said Harriet, her\\nconscience opposing such censure; “at least, he is very good natured,\\nand I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\\nfor—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he\\nmay like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must\\nconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes\\nto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\\n_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\\nMartin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\\nhis being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as\\nto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.”\\n\\n“Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\\nparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.”\\n\\n“Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.”\\n\\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a “very\\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\\nher husband could write a good letter.”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?”\\n\\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\\nsentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\\naccepted after all.\\n\\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\\nby speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\\nidea of Mr. Elton.\\n\\n“I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,” was said in rather a\\nsorrowful tone.\\n\\n“Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\\nAbbey-Mill.”\\n\\n“And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\\nbut at Hartfield.”\\n\\nSome time afterwards it was, “I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for\\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\\nlinen-draper.”\\n\\n“One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\\nthe only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\\nthemselves.”\\n\\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\\n\\n“Now he has got my letter,” said she softly. “I wonder what they are\\nall doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will be\\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.”\\n\\n“Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\\nemployed,” cried Emma. “At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.”\\n\\n“My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street.”\\n\\n“Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\\ntheir imaginations all are!”\\n\\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\\nspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a\\nbed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\\nrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\\njust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\\ntwo to Mrs. Goddard’s, but it was then to be settled that she should\\nreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\\n\\nWhile she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\\nWoodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\\nmind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and\\nwas induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of\\nhis own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr.\\nKnightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his\\nshort, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies\\nand civil hesitations of the other.\\n\\n“Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\\nconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma’s advice and\\ngo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\\nbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\\nMr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.”\\n\\n“My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.”\\n\\n“I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\\nentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\\nthree turns—my winter walk.”\\n\\n“You cannot do better, sir.”\\n\\n“I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am\\na very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides,\\nyou have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\\nthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open\\nthe garden door for you.”\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\\nimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\\nchat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\\nvoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\\n\\n“I cannot rate her beauty as you do,” said he; “but she is a pretty\\nlittle creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\\ndisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\\nhands she will turn out a valuable woman.”\\n\\n“I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\\nwanting.”\\n\\n“Come,” said he, “you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\\nthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl’s\\ngiggle; she really does you credit.”\\n\\n“Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had\\nbeen of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where\\nthey may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.”\\n\\n“You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?”\\n\\n“Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\\nintended.”\\n\\n“Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.”\\n\\n“Highbury gossips!—Tiresome wretches!”\\n\\n“Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.”\\n\\nEmma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\\nnothing. He presently added, with a smile,\\n\\n“I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I\\nhave good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\\nsomething to her advantage.”\\n\\n“Indeed! how so? of what sort?”\\n\\n“A very serious sort, I assure you;” still smiling.\\n\\n“Very serious! I can think of but one thing—Who is in love with her?\\nWho makes you their confidant?”\\n\\nEmma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton’s having dropt a hint.\\nMr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew\\nMr. Elton looked up to him.\\n\\n“I have reason to think,” he replied, “that Harriet Smith will soon\\nhave an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable\\nquarter:—Robert Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this\\nsummer, seems to have done his business. He is desperately in love and\\nmeans to marry her.”\\n\\n“He is very obliging,” said Emma; “but is he sure that Harriet means to\\nmarry him?”\\n\\n“Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\\nI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I\\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not\\nallow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be\\nat Mrs. Goddard’s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without\\nthinking him at all a tiresome wretch.”\\n\\n“Pray, Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech, “how do you know that Mr. Martin\\ndid not speak yesterday?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied he, surprized, “I do not absolutely know it; but\\nit may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?”\\n\\n“Come,” said she, “I will tell you something, in return for what you\\nhave told me. He did speak yesterday—that is, he wrote, and was\\nrefused.”\\n\\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\\nstood up, in tall indignation, and said,\\n\\n“Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\\nfoolish girl about?”\\n\\n“Oh! to be sure,” cried Emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man\\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”\\n\\n“Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.”\\n\\n“I saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”\\n\\n“You saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.”\\n\\n“And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized\\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\\ngot over.”\\n\\n“Not Harriet’s equal!” exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “No, he is not\\nher equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\\nHarriet Smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\\ncan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\\nwould not regret your friend’s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, ‘Even Emma, with\\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.’”\\n\\n“I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\\nYou are not just to Harriet’s claims. They would be estimated very\\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\\nsociety.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a\\ndegradation.”\\n\\n“A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!”\\n\\n“As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\\nwhom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\\nis a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very\\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\\ncomfort.—That she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me; that\\nshe associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\\ndeny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.”\\n\\n“Whoever might be her parents,” said Mr. Knightley, “whoever may have\\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.\\nGoddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs.\\nGoddard’s line, to have Mrs. Goddard’s acquaintance. Her friends\\nevidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\\nShe desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a\\nfriend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\\nbeyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.\\nShe had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given\\nit. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would\\nnever have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not\\nbeing disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling\\nto address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to\\nconceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it\\nhe had encouragement.”\\n\\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\\nagain.\\n\\n“You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\\nunjust to Harriet. Harriet’s claims to marry well are not so\\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\\nher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\\nhowever, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\\ngood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\\nthey are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\\nis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\\npeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\\nphilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\\nfaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\\nbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\\namong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\\nnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\\nsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\\ngreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\\nmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\\ntemper, the highest claims a woman could possess.”\\n\\n“Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\\nit as you do.”\\n\\n“To be sure!” cried she playfully. “I know _that_ is the feeling of you\\nall. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man\\ndelights in—what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No—pray let\\nher have time to look about her.”\\n\\n“I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said Mr. Knightley\\npresently, “though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will\\npuff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a\\nclaim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good\\nenough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of\\nmischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations\\ntoo high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so\\nfast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may\\nchuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very\\nfond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most\\nprudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they\\nmight be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be\\nrevealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable,\\nand happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry\\ngreatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of\\nconsequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs.\\nGoddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is\\na girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and\\nis glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.”\\n\\n“We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\\ncan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\\nangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is\\nimpossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must\\nprevent any second application. She must abide by the evil of having\\nrefused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will\\nnot pretend to say that I might not influence her a little; but I\\nassure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His\\nappearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad, that if she\\never were disposed to favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that\\nbefore she had seen any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was\\nthe brother of her friends, and he took pains to please her; and\\naltogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great\\nassistant) she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him\\ndisagreeable. But the case is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen\\nare; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\\nwith Harriet.”\\n\\n“Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried Mr.\\nKnightley.—“Robert Martin’s manners have sense, sincerity, and\\ngood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility\\nthan Harriet Smith could understand.”\\n\\nEmma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\\non Emma’s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\\n\\n“Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope it\\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as\\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\\nwill be all labour in vain.”\\n\\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\\n\\n“Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet’s.\\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.”\\n\\n“I am very much obliged to you,” said Emma, laughing again. “If I had\\nset my heart on Mr. Elton’s marrying Harriet, it would have been very\\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.”\\n\\n“Good morning to you,”—said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.\\n\\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of her’s, than in his. She did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversary’s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet’s\\nstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\\nof the young man’s coming to Mrs. Goddard’s that morning, and meeting\\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\\nwoman’s friendship and woman’s feelings would not justify.\\n\\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\\nof Mr. Knightley’s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\\ndisposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\\nof prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\\n\\nHarriet’s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard’s to attend a sick child,\\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\\nmore about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\\n“that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton\\nhad not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\\nherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual\\nbefore he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave\\nlooks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not\\nrepent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more\\njustified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next\\nfew days.\\n\\nThe Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\\nElton’s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\nsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half\\nsentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet’s\\nfeelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and\\nsteady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was\\nsoon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin’s being no otherwise remembered,\\nthan as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage\\nto the latter.\\n\\nHer views of improving her little friend’s mind, by a great deal of\\nuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\\nfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\\neasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\\nrange and work at Harriet’s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\\nher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\\npursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\\nwas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\\nall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\\nquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\\nciphers and trophies.\\n\\nIn this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\\nnot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard’s, had written\\nout at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint\\nof it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse’s help, to get a great many\\nmore. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as\\nHarriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of\\nthe first order, in form as well as quantity.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\\ngirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\\nin. “So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he\\nwondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.”\\nAnd it always ended in “Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.”\\n\\nHis good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did\\nnot at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had\\ndesired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\\nsomething, he thought, might come from that quarter.\\n\\nIt was by no means his daughter’s wish that the intellects of Highbury\\nin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\\nwhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really\\ngood enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she\\nhad the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his\\nrecollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most\\nearnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe\\na compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their\\ntwo or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at\\nlast he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known\\ncharade,\\n\\nMy first doth affliction denote,\\n    Which my second is destin’d to feel\\nAnd my whole is the best antidote\\n    That affliction to soften and heal.—\\n\\n\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\\npages ago already.\\n\\n“Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?” said she;\\n“that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be\\neasier to you.”\\n\\n“Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\\nlife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse”—he\\nstopt a moment—“or Miss Smith could inspire him.”\\n\\nThe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called\\nfor a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\\ncontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\\nto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\\nmanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\\n\\n“I do not offer it for Miss Smith’s collection,” said he. “Being my\\nfriend’s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\\nbut perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.”\\n\\nThe speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\\nunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it\\neasier to meet her eye than her friend’s. He was gone the next\\nmoment:—after another moment’s pause,\\n\\n“Take it,” said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\\nHarriet—“it is for you. Take your own.”\\n\\nBut Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\\nloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\\n\\nTo Miss——\\n\\n\\nCHARADE.\\n\\n\\nMy first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\nAnother view of man, my second brings,\\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\nBut ah! united, what reverse we have!\\n    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\n    Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\\n    May its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\n\\nShe cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\\nagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\\npassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,\\nwhile Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope\\nand dulness, “Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\\ncharades. _Courtship_—a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\\nis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly—‘Pray, Miss Smith,\\ngive me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\\nintentions in the same glance.’\\n\\nMay its approval beam in that soft eye!\\n\\n\\nHarriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets, the\\njustest that could be given.\\n\\nThy ready wit the word will soon supply.\\n\\n\\nHumph—Harriet’s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\\nlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\\nbenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\\nyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\\nindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\\nnow.”\\n\\nShe was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\\neagerness of Harriet’s wondering questions.\\n\\n“What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an idea—I\\ncannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\\nit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is\\nit kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young\\nlady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\\n\\nAnd woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\n\\nCan it be Neptune?\\n\\nBehold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\n\\nOr a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\\nsyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?”\\n\\n“Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\\nof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a\\nfriend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\\n\\nFor Miss ———, read Miss Smith.\\n\\nMy first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\\n    Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\\n\\n\\nThat is _court_.\\n\\nAnother view of man, my second brings;\\n    Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\\n\\n\\nThat is _ship_;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream.\\n\\nBut ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\\n    Man’s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\\nLord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\\n    And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\\n\\n\\nA very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I\\nthink, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\\ncomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\\nits being written for you and to you.”\\n\\nHarriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the\\nconcluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\\nspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\\nEmma spoke for her.\\n\\n“There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,”\\nsaid she, “that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton’s intentions. You\\nare his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\\nthought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now,\\nit is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my\\nwishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet,\\njust so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that\\nhas happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and\\nMr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its\\neligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I\\ncongratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an\\nattachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a\\nconnexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing\\nthat you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix\\nyou in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to\\nme, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance\\nwhich can never raise a blush in either of us.”\\n\\n“Dear Miss Woodhouse!”—and “Dear Miss Woodhouse,” was all that Harriet,\\nwith many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\\narrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear\\nto her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as\\nshe ought. Mr. Elton’s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\\n\\n“Whatever you say is always right,” cried Harriet, “and therefore I\\nsuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\\nhave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\\nwho might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\\nis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses—‘To Miss ———.’\\nDear me, how clever!—Could it really be meant for me?”\\n\\n“I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\\ncertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the\\nplay, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\\nmatter-of-fact prose.”\\n\\n“It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a\\nmonth ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take\\nplace!”\\n\\n“When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and\\nreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\\nevidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of\\nother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\\nYou and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\\nanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\\nwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\\nsomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\\ndirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\\n\\nThe course of true love never did run smooth—\\n\\n\\nA Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\\npassage.”\\n\\n“That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all people,\\nwho did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\\nhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\\nquite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\\nsays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\\nthat he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\\nexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\\never preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\\nto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!—The two Abbots and\\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look\\ntoo, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.”\\n\\n“This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be, must\\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\\nsee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\\nevery assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same\\ncountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\\nbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\\ncommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\\nrespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\\nunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\\nother. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have\\nmade any thing like it.”\\n\\n“I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\\nyesterday.”\\n\\n“I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.”\\n\\n“I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.”\\n\\n“It is as long again as almost all we have had before.”\\n\\n“I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\\nthings in general cannot be too short.”\\n\\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\\n\\n“It is one thing,” said she, presently—her cheeks in a glow—“to have\\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\\nthis.”\\n\\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin’s\\nprose.\\n\\n“Such sweet lines!” continued Harriet—“these two last!—But how shall I\\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?—Oh! Miss\\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?”\\n\\n“Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall\\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.”\\n\\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.”\\n\\n“Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\\nnot write it into your book.”\\n\\n“Oh! but those two lines are”—\\n\\n—“The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for private\\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\\nupon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\\nthan his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\\nor neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\\nbe no possible reflection on you.”\\n\\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\\nas to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\\nof publicity.\\n\\n“I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,” said she.\\n\\n“Very well,” replied Emma; “a most natural feeling; and the longer it\\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\\ngallantry towards us all!—You must let me read it to him.”\\n\\nHarriet looked grave.\\n\\n“My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You\\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\\nthis charade.”\\n\\n“Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.”\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of “Well, my dears, how does\\nyour book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?”\\n\\n“Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose,\\nby a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\\nit in.”\\n\\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\\npart as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\\n\\n“Aye, that’s very just, indeed, that’s very properly said. Very true.\\n‘Woman, lovely woman.’ It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\\neasily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so\\nprettily, but you, Emma.”\\n\\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very\\ntender sigh, he added,\\n\\n“Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\\nremember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard\\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\\nseveral.\\n\\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\\n    Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\\nThe hood-wink’d boy I called to aid,\\nThough of his near approach afraid,\\n    So fatal to my suit before.\\n\\n\\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all\\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.”\\n\\n“Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick’s, you know.”\\n\\n“Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.\\n\\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\n\\n\\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what\\nroom there will be for the children?”\\n\\n“Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\nhas;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you\\nknow. Why should there be any change?”\\n\\n“I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since\\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John Knightley’s being a\\nlawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away\\nfrom us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\\nTaylor here!”\\n\\n“She will not be surprized, papa, at least.”\\n\\n“I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\\nfirst heard she was going to be married.”\\n\\n“We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\\nhere.”\\n\\n“Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is\\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.”\\n\\n“It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of\\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim\\nthis Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him,\\nthan with us.”\\n\\n“It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\\nanywhere but at Hartfield.”\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley’s claims on his\\nbrother, or any body’s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\\nmusing a little while, and then said,\\n\\n“But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.”\\n\\n“Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\\nnot think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\\nhusband.”\\n\\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\\nby the idea of his daughter’s attachment to her husband, she\\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\\n\\n“Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?”\\n\\n“Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.”\\n\\n“I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.”\\n\\n“Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, ‘Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\\nof string?’ and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\\nthem very often.”\\n\\n“He appears rough to you,” said Emma, “because you are so very gentle\\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\\nmisbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\\naffectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\\nfather. The children are all fond of him.”\\n\\n“And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\\nvery frightful way!”\\n\\n“But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.”\\n\\n“Well, I cannot understand it.”\\n\\n“That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.”\\n\\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\\npreparation for the regular four o’clock dinner, the hero of this\\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\\nhis the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and\\nshe imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse’s party could be made\\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\\ndining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\\nconditionally to come.\\n\\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she\\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\\npaper from the table, she returned it—\\n\\n“Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\\nthank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\\nventured to write it into Miss Smith’s collection. Your friend will not\\ntake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\\neight lines.”\\n\\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\\nrather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about\\n“honour,”—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open\\non the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the\\nview of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\\n\\n“You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\\nnot be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman’s\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.”\\n\\n“I have no hesitation in saying,” replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke; “I have no hesitation in saying—at least if\\nmy friend feels at all as _I_ do—I have not the smallest doubt that,\\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at\\nthe book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as\\nthe proudest moment of his life.”\\n\\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a\\nsort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet’s share.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\\n\\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\\neyes.—Emma’s remark was—\\n\\n“There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\\ndays.”—Harriet’s was—\\n\\n“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow\\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.”\\n\\n“I do not often walk this way _now_,” said Emma, as they proceeded,\\n“but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\\nthis part of Highbury.”\\n\\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\\nElton’s seeing ready wit in her.\\n\\n“I wish we could contrive it,” said she; “but I cannot think of any\\ntolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire\\nabout of his housekeeper—no message from my father.”\\n\\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again—\\n\\n“I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!”—\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied,\\n\\n“My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\\nI must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am\\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\\nintention of ever marrying at all.”\\n\\n“Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.”\\n\\n“I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.”\\n\\n“Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!”—\\n\\n“I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\\nmistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\\nfirst and always right in any man’s eyes as I am in my father’s.”\\n\\n“But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!”\\n\\n“That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so\\nsmiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to\\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.”\\n\\n“But still, you will be an old maid! and that’s so dreadful!”\\n\\n“Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\\npleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.”\\n\\n“Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\\ngrow old?”\\n\\n“If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman’s\\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.”\\n\\n“Do you know Miss Bates’s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\\na hundred times—but are you acquainted?”\\n\\n“Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\\nfrom her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\\ntires me to death.”\\n\\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\\n\\n“These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\\nevery thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?”\\n\\n“Very true,” said Harriet. “Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\\nelse.”\\n\\n“And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,” said\\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\\ninto the lane again. “I do not think it will,” stopping to look once\\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\\ngreater within.\\n\\n“Oh! dear, no,” said her companion.\\n\\nThey walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\\ntime only to say farther,\\n\\n“Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we\\ncan for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to\\nourselves.”\\n\\nHarriet could just answer, “Oh! dear, yes,” before the gentleman joined\\nthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\\nfirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what\\ncould be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\\naccompany them.\\n\\n“To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,” thought Emma;\\n“to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of\\nlove on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.”\\n\\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet’s habits of\\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\\nthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\\nfetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\\nwithout any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\\ninvoluntarily: the child’s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\\nto join them.\\n\\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was\\nonly giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday’s party at\\nhis friend Cole’s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\\ncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and\\nall the dessert.\\n\\n“This would soon have led to something better, of course,” was her\\nconsoling reflection; “any thing interests between those who love; and\\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\\ncould but have kept longer away!”\\n\\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off\\nshort, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged\\nto entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself\\nto rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\\n\\n“Part of my lace is gone,” said she, “and I do not know how I am to\\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\\nstop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or\\nstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on.”\\n\\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house\\nand endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they\\nwere taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\\nbehind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\\nbetween them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to\\nreceive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\\nto leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\\nElton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\\najar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\\nadjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\\ncould be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and\\nmake her appearance.\\n\\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\\nserious.\\n\\n“Cautious, very cautious,” thought Emma; “he advances inch by inch, and\\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.”\\n\\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\\nthem forward to the great event.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma’s power\\nto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\\nsister’s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\\nand then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\\nand during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\\nexpected—she did not herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional,\\nfortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They\\nmight advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow\\nor other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more\\nleisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the\\nless they will do for themselves.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\\nfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual\\ninterest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had\\nbeen divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays\\nof this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it\\nwas therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by\\ntheir Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not\\nbe induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella’s sake; and\\nwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\\nforestalling this too short visit.\\n\\nHe thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\\nof the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\\nof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\\nthe sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\\nKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of\\nnursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of\\nsuch an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and\\nvariously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion\\nwhich his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\\nendured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the\\nfeelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that\\nin spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her\\nlittle ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and\\nattendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,\\nwhich they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the\\nchildren were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in\\nthemselves or in any restless attendance on them.\\n\\nMrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\\nquiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;\\nwrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so\\ntenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher\\nties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a\\nfault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or\\nany quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited\\nalso much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,\\nover-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,\\nand was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\\nof Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper,\\nand a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\\nrising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\\ncharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\ngenerally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He\\nwas not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to\\ndeserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection;\\nand, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that\\nany natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme\\nsweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and\\nquickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an\\nungracious, or say a severe thing.\\n\\nHe was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\\nin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\\nIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\\npassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella’s sister,\\nbut they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\\npraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\\ncompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all\\nin her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\\nforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\\nthat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse’s peculiarities and\\nfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\\nsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr.\\nJohn Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and\\ngenerally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often\\nfor Emma’s charity, especially as there was all the pain of\\napprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The\\nbeginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest\\nfeelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass\\naway in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and\\ncomposed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a\\nsigh, called his daughter’s attention to the sad change at Hartfield\\nsince she had been there last.\\n\\n“Ah, my dear,” said he, “poor Miss Taylor—It is a grievous business.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, sir,” cried she with ready sympathy, “how you must miss her!\\nAnd dear Emma, too!—What a dreadful loss to you both!—I have been so\\ngrieved for you.—I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\\nher.—It is a sad change indeed.—But I hope she is pretty well, sir.”\\n\\n“Pretty well, my dear—I hope—pretty well.—I do not know but that the\\nplace agrees with her tolerably.”\\n\\nMr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any\\ndoubts of the air of Randalls.\\n\\n“Oh! no—none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\\nlife—never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.”\\n\\n“Very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.\\n\\n“And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked Isabella in the\\nplaintive tone which just suited her father.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse hesitated.—“Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.”\\n\\n“Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\\nmarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\\nhave we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\\neither at Randalls or here—and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\\nfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\\nis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy\\nway, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body\\nmust be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought\\nalso to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our\\nmissing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated—which\\nis the exact truth.”\\n\\n“Just as it should be,” said Mr. John Knightley, “and just as I hoped\\nit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not\\nbe doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\\neasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\\nnow you have Emma’s account, I hope you will be satisfied.”\\n\\n“Why, to be sure,” said Mr. Woodhouse—“yes, certainly—I cannot deny\\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\\noften—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.”\\n\\n“It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite\\nforget poor Mr. Weston.”\\n\\n“I think, indeed,” said John Knightley pleasantly, “that Mr. Weston has\\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\\nclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.”\\n\\n“Me, my love,” cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.—\\n“Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\\nMiss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\\nslighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\\nnothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\\nflying Henry’s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever\\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\\nthat note, at twelve o’clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body\\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.”\\n\\n“Where is the young man?” said John Knightley. “Has he been here on\\nthis occasion—or has he not?”\\n\\n“He has not been here yet,” replied Emma. “There was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.”\\n\\n“But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father. “He\\nwrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—”\\n\\n“My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.”\\n\\n“Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought it—and\\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\\nfly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\\n28th—and began, ‘My dear Madam,’ but I forget how it went on; and it\\nwas signed ‘F. C. Weston Churchill.’—I remember that perfectly.”\\n\\n“How very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\\nKnightley. “I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\\nsomething so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents\\nand natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\\nwith him. To give up one’s child! I really never could think well of\\nany body who proposed such a thing to any body else.”\\n\\n“Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,” observed Mr.\\nJohn Knightley coolly. “But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\\nplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\\naffection, or any thing that home affords.”\\n\\nEmma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and\\nhad half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\\nwould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable\\nand valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home\\nto himself, whence resulted her brother’s disposition to look down on\\nthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\\nimportant.—It had a high claim to forbearance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nMr. Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of\\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\\nIsabella’s first day. Emma’s sense of right however had decided it; and\\nbesides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\\ninvitation.\\n\\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration\\nof friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the\\nchildren with her—the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months\\nold, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to\\nbe danced about in her aunt’s arms. It did assist; for though he began\\nwith grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of\\nthem all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with\\nall the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends\\nagain; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and\\nthen a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring\\nthe baby,\\n\\n“What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and\\nnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.”\\n\\n“If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and\\nwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings\\nwith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might\\nalways think alike.”\\n\\n“To be sure—our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\\nwrong.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, smiling—“and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\\nyou were born.”\\n\\n“A material difference then,” she replied—“and no doubt you were much\\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\\nnearer?”\\n\\n“Yes—a good deal _nearer_.”\\n\\n“But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\\nthink differently.”\\n\\n“I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years’ experience, and by\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\\nold grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.”\\n\\n“That’s true,” she cried—“very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects\\non my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know\\nthat Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.”\\n\\n“A man cannot be more so,” was his short, full answer.\\n\\n“Ah!—Indeed I am very sorry.—Come, shake hands with me.”\\n\\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\\nKnightley made his appearance, and “How d’ye do, George?” and “John,\\nhow are you?” succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\\ncalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which\\nwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the\\ngood of the other.\\n\\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\\nentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in\\none or the other.\\n\\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\\nof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\\nand who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had\\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some\\ncurious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\\nhome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\\nyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\\ninteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\\npart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\\ndrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\\ndestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\\nentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\\nmanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\\nthing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\\neagerness.\\n\\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\\n\\n“My poor dear Isabella,” said he, fondly taking her hand, and\\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\\nfive children—“How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\\nmy dear—and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.—You and I\\nwill have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\\nhave a little gruel.”\\n\\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both\\nthe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as\\nherself;—and two basins only were ordered. After a little more\\ndiscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being\\ntaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of\\ngrave reflection,\\n\\n“It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.”\\n\\n“Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir—or we should not\\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\\nthe weakness in little Bella’s throat,—both sea air and bathing.”\\n\\n“Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.”\\n\\n“Come, come,” cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, “I must\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;—I\\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet;\\nand he never forgets you.”\\n\\n“Oh! good Mr. Perry—how is he, sir?”\\n\\n“Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he\\nhas not time to take care of himself—he tells me he has not time to\\ntake care of himself—which is very sad—but he is always wanted all\\nround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice\\nanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.”\\n\\n“And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I\\nhave a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.”\\n\\n“I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\\nyou had better let him look at little Bella’s throat.”\\n\\n“Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\\nWingfield’s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.”\\n\\n“It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\\nto her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\\nspoken to—\\n\\n“You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,” said Emma, “I\\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.”\\n\\n“Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them\\nin most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\\nBates—I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.—They are\\nalways so pleased to see my children.—And that excellent Miss\\nBates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they, sir?”\\n\\n“Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\\nbad cold about a month ago.”\\n\\n“How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\\ngeneral or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.”\\n\\n“That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\\naltogether a sickly season.”\\n\\n“No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\\nexcept—\\n\\n“Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\\nsickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!—and the\\nair so bad!”\\n\\n“No, indeed—_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\\nvery superior to most others!—You must not confound us with London in\\ngeneral, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is\\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but\\n_we_ are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.”\\n\\n“Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but\\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I\\nthink you are any of you looking well at present.”\\n\\n“I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you\\ndo not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,” turning her eyes with\\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\\n\\n“Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\\nvery far from looking well.”\\n\\n“What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?” cried Mr. John\\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\\n\\n“I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\\nwell—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\\nyou left home.”\\n\\n“My dear Isabella,”—exclaimed he hastily—“pray do not concern yourself\\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.”\\n\\n“I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,”\\ncried Emma, “about your friend Mr. Graham’s intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?”\\n\\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\\nworse to hear than Isabella’s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\\n\\n“That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!” said Mrs. John Knightley.—“It is so\\nlong since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\\nregret excessively on dear Emma’s account that she cannot be more at\\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\\ndelightful companion for Emma.”\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\\n\\n“Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\\nbetter companion than Harriet.”\\n\\n“I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\\nvery accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma’s age.”\\n\\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\\na great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting\\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\\nPhilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\\ntolerably;—but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\\ndangerous opening.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\\nwith tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma’s ear expressed, “Ah!\\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\\ndoes not bear talking of.” And for a little while she hoped he would\\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\\nminutes, however, he began with,\\n\\n“I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\\ninstead of coming here.”\\n\\n“But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a\\ngreat deal of good.”\\n\\n“And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\\nhear you had fixed upon South End.”\\n\\n“I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\\na mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\\nthe least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\\nand his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.”\\n\\n“You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—Perry\\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\\nby what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\\nthe sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have\\nconsulted Perry.”\\n\\n“But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how\\ngreat it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.”\\n\\n“Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all,\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\\nill-judged measure.”\\n\\nEmma’s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\\nreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\nbrother-in-law’s breaking out.\\n\\n“Mr. Perry,” said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, “would do\\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family to\\none part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more than\\nhis drugs.” He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\\nsarcastic dryness, “If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.”\\n\\n“True, true,” cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition—“very\\ntrue. That’s a consideration indeed.—But John, as to what I was telling\\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\\nyour opinion.”\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing\\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the\\nimmediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\\nother, prevented any renewal of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\\nKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over\\nwhat she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had\\nnothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.\\nIt was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being much too short.\\n\\nIn general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\\nmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\\nthere was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\\ndenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was\\npersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\\nthe party.\\n\\nHow they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\\ncould, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually\\nat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\\nthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\\nto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\\nHarriet also.\\n\\nHarriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\\nonly persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well\\nas the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse’s habits and inclination being\\nconsulted in every thing.\\n\\nThe evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\\nMr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\\nby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\\na cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\\nGoddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma\\ncalled on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with\\nregard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:\\nMrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,\\nand Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which\\nexcluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not\\nspeak of her loss without many tears.\\n\\nEmma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard’s\\nunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much\\nMr. Elton’s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at\\nlast tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a\\nmost comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had\\nnot advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard’s door, when she was met by\\nMr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on\\nslowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the\\nrumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he\\nmight carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr.\\nJohn Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two\\neldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a\\ncountry run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton\\nand rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend’s\\ncomplaint;—“a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\\nalarmed her with them.” Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\\nhe exclaimed,\\n\\n“A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\\nWhy does not Perry see her?”\\n\\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard’s experience and\\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\\nthan not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject,\\n\\n“It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like\\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\\nshould really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from\\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel\\nthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\\ngreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\\nElton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\\na little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”\\n\\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her’s,\\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma,\\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear\\nhim impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied\\nwith his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly\\nvery cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from\\nRandalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet\\nevery hour of the evening.\\n\\n“You do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies to Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston.”\\n\\nBut hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\\noffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton’s only\\nobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\\nsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\\nhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\\nnever had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\\nhe next looked at her.\\n\\n“Well,” said she to herself, “this is most strange!—After I had got him\\noff so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\\nbehind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many men,\\nespecially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining\\nout—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\\ntheir employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing\\ngives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\\nvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in\\nlove with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must\\ndine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see\\nready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.”\\n\\nSoon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\\nmanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\\nassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard’s for news of her fair\\nfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\\nher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he\\nsighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\\napprobation much in his favour.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\\nbegan with—\\n\\n“I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\\nElton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\\nplease, every feature works.”\\n\\n“Mr. Elton’s manners are not perfect,” replied Emma; “but where there\\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\\ngreat deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\\nvalue.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, “he seems\\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.”\\n\\n“Me!” she replied with a smile of astonishment, “are you imagining me\\nto be Mr. Elton’s object?”\\n\\n“Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\\nnow.”\\n\\n“Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!”\\n\\n“I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\\nso or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.”\\n\\n“I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\\nare very good friends, and nothing more;” and she walked on, amusing\\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\\nin want of counsel. He said no more.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\\nof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\\nwhite world in a very short time.\\n\\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\\ndiscontent.\\n\\n“A man,” said he, “must have a very good opinion of himself when he\\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\\nabsurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing\\npeople to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people’s not staying\\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\\nshould deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\\nthat he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\\nanother man’s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and\\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\\nat home.”\\n\\nEmma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\\ndoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the “Very true, my\\nlove,” which must have been usually administered by his travelling\\ncompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any\\nanswer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\nher lips.\\n\\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.\\nElton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma\\nthought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all\\nobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\\nindeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\\naccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while\\ndressing, and the answer had been, “Much the same—not better.”\\n\\n“_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard’s,” said she presently, “was not so\\npleasant as I had hoped—‘Not better’ was _my_ answer.”\\n\\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\\nsentiment as he answered.\\n\\n“Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard’s door, which I did the very last thing\\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had\\nflattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew\\nhad been given her in the morning.”\\n\\nEmma smiled and answered—“My visit was of use to the nervous part of\\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it\\nis a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\\nprobably heard.”\\n\\n“Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—”\\n\\n“He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party\\nto-day!”\\n\\n“Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.”\\n\\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\\n\\n“What an excellent device,” said he, “the use of a sheepskin for\\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold\\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\\nrendered a gentleman’s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\\ncold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!\\nsnows a little I see.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said John Knightley, “and I think we shall have a good deal of\\nit.”\\n\\n“Christmas weather,” observed Mr. Elton. “Quite seasonable; and\\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\\nyesterday, and prevent this day’s party, which it might very possibly\\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\\nworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend’s house once for a week.\\nNothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\\nget away till that very day se’nnight.”\\n\\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\\nsaid only, coolly,\\n\\n“I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.”\\n\\nAt another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\\nastonished now at Mr. Elton’s spirits for other feelings. Harriet\\nseemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\\n\\n“We are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the\\ngreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs. Weston\\nindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\\nhospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where\\nsmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\\nMr. Weston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten\\ncomfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,\\nfall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,\\n(turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your\\napprobation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large\\nparties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.”\\n\\n“I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with\\nany body.”\\n\\n“Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\\nbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be\\npaid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\\nenjoyment.”\\n\\n“My first enjoyment,” replied John Knightley, as they passed through\\nthe sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\\nwalked into Mrs. Weston’s drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose his\\njoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton\\nmust smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\\nplace.—Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\\nhappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\\nMr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\\nworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\\none, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\\nunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\\nlittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\\nand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour’s uninterrupted\\ncommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\\nof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\\n\\nThis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not\\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\\nthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\\ngrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\\nMr. Elton’s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\\nthat was enjoyable to the utmost.\\n\\nThe misfortune of Harriet’s cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to\\ngive the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\\nIsabella’s coming, and of Emma’s being to follow, and had indeed just\\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\\nalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\\nand welcome her dear Emma.\\n\\nEmma’s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\\nto her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility\\ntowards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\\nwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\\nsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\\nhim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\\nsuggestion of “Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\\npossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\\nHarriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!”—Yet he would be so anxious for\\nher being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and\\nso delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\\ndrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\\nlike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\\ngood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\\nHarriet’s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\\npositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\\ngoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\\nElton’s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard\\nenough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his\\nson; she heard the words “my son,” and “Frank,” and “my son,” repeated\\nseveral times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much\\nsuspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but\\nbefore she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past\\nthat any reviving question from her would have been awkward.\\n\\nNow, it so happened that in spite of Emma’s resolution of never\\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\\nthought—especially since his father’s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if\\nshe _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\\nfamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\\ntheir friends’ imaginations.\\n\\nWith such sensations, Mr. Elton’s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\\ncross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for\\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\\ndinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\\nhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\\nto her,\\n\\n“We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to\\nsee two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\\nson—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not\\nhear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting\\nFrank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us\\nwithin a fortnight.”\\n\\nEmma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\\nhis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\\nparty quite complete.\\n\\n“He has been wanting to come to us,” continued Mr. Weston, “ever since\\nSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\\nown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\\nourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\\nBut now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\\nJanuary.”\\n\\n“What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\\nanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\\nShe does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\\nknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is\\nquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the\\nother room. There are secrets in all families, you know)—The case is,\\nthat a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\\nJanuary; and that Frank’s coming depends upon their being put off. If\\nthey are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it\\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\\nto the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as\\nconfident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\\nbeing here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the\\nupper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\\nlittle used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\\neffects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.”\\n\\n“I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied\\nEmma; “but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\\nwill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.”\\n\\n“Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\\nthe place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to\\nspeak ill of her, on Frank’s account; for I do believe her to be very\\nfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any\\nbody, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\\nway—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\\nto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\\nthat he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it\\nto any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\\ngeneral; and the devil of a temper.”\\n\\nEmma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet\\nobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.—\\nMrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\\nsecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\\nof: “for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter\\nstands?”\\n\\n“Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”\\n\\n“My Emma!” replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, “what is the certainty of\\ncaprice?” Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\\nbefore—“You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt’s spirits and pleasure; in\\nshort, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture on the\\ntruth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,” replied\\nIsabella: “and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\\nthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\\nperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any\\nthing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she\\nnever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\\nhave made them!”\\n\\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\\nheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from\\nher, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,\\nwas a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\\nwhom he was always comfortable.\\n\\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\\nsaying,\\n\\n“And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.”\\n\\n“Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\\nChurchills’ to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.”\\n\\n“He ought to come,” said Emma. “If he could stay only a couple of days,\\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having\\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\\ninto bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\\nwants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_’s being under\\nsuch restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\\nhe likes it.”\\n\\n“One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\\none decides upon what he can do,” replied Mrs. Weston. “One ought to\\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\\nevery thing gives way to her.”\\n\\n“But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\\nshe owes nothing at all.”\\n\\n“My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\\nbe.”\\n\\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, “I shall not be satisfied, unless\\nhe comes.”\\n\\n“He may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued Mrs.\\nWeston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance\\nof his coming away from them to visit us.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea\\nhe was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\\ncompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\\nthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty\\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\\nvery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and\\nEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\\nwith scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\\n\\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\\nfriendly smiles.\\n\\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,\\nlovely, amiable friend. “Did she know?—had she heard any thing about\\nher, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must\\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.” And\\nin this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\\nterror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\\n\\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\\non Harriet’s—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\\nagain, for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear—there was no concealing\\nit—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\\nWeston to implore her assistance, “Would not she give him her\\nsupport?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss\\nWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard’s till it were certain that Miss\\nSmith’s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\\npromise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?”\\n\\n“So scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for\\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I\\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.”\\n\\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston’s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right\\nof first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked\\nand offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the\\npurpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she\\nthought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,\\nremoving to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\\n\\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,\\nwith a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\\nWoodhouse:\\n\\n“This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.\\nSomething new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\\nthrough a storm of snow.”\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and\\nEmma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\\n\\n“I admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out\\nin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\\nEvery body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;\\nand I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two’s snow\\ncan hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one\\nis blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the\\nother at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\\nmidnight.”\\n\\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\\n\\n“What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?” was Mr.\\nWoodhouse’s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\\n\\nHis eldest daughter’s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\\nRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\\n\\n“You had better order the carriage directly, my love,” said she; “I\\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\\nall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\\nthat gives me cold.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” replied he. “Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home,\\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.”\\n\\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\\nleft the room immediately after his brother’s first report of the snow,\\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury\\nroad—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly\\nenough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\\nbut the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\\nhim in there being nothing to apprehend.\\n\\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father’s account, who was\\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—\\n\\n“Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?”\\n\\n“I am ready, if the others are.”\\n\\n“Shall I ring the bell?”\\n\\n“Yes, do.”\\n\\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes\\nmore, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his\\nown house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\\n\\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\\noccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\\nWeston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of\\nalarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\\ndiscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. “He was\\nafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\\nas they could;” and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\\nslow and wait for the other carriage.\\n\\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\\nand that they were to have a tête-à-tête drive. It would not have been\\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston’s good wine, and felt sure that he\\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\\n\\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\\nfound her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and\\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\\nknown, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but\\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\\nreally was so. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent\\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\\nreplied,\\n\\n“I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\\nyourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be\\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.”\\n\\n“Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!”—And\\nhe repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\\n\\n“Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.”\\n\\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but\\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he\\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\\nfavourable answer.\\n\\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\\nreplied,\\n\\n“It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\\nmonth, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\\nof observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness\\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\\nprofessions.”\\n\\n“Good Heaven!” cried Mr. Elton, “what can be the meaning of this?—Miss\\nSmith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\\nexistence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\\nsorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be\\ninsinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me.”\\n\\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of\\nall her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton’s sanguine state of mind, he\\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed—\\n\\n“Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.”\\n\\n“No, sir,” cried Emma, “it confesses no such thing. So far from having\\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\\nshould have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther\\nfrom my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of\\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\\njudged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\\nSmith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?”\\n\\n“Never, madam,” cried he, affronted in his turn: “never, I assure you.\\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of\\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\\nto—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my\\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\\nI received—”\\n\\n“Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely\\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\\npresent.”\\n\\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\\nsyllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to\\nHartfield.\\n\\nThere she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had\\nbeen trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\\nLane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in\\nstrange hands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as\\nif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\\nJohn Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\\nattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\\nfather, as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\\ngruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\\nday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\\nexcept herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\\nit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till\\nthe usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet\\nreflection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\\nand be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow\\nof every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every\\nthing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of\\nall. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\\nwould gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in\\nerror—more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\\n\\n“If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\\nany thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me—but poor\\nHarriet!”\\n\\nHow she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never\\nthought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well as she\\ncould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\\nmisled.\\n\\nThe picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the\\ncharade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had\\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its “ready\\nwit”—but then the “soft eyes”—in fact it suited neither; it was a\\njumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\\nthick-headed nonsense?\\n\\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet’s friend.\\n\\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\\n\\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton’s wanting to pay his\\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\\nbe cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\\n\\nBut—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\\nhim!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down\\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\\npresumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking.\\n\\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the\\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\\nhim to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied\\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\\nhers.\\n\\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\\n\\n“Here have I,” said she, “actually talked poor Harriet into being very\\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I\\ncould not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer.”\\n\\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\\nresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\\ndreadfully.\\n\\nTo youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma’s, though under temporary\\ngloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\\nspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\\nand of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\\nto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\\nsoftened pain and brighter hope.\\n\\nEmma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\\nto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\\ndepend on getting tolerably out of it.\\n\\nIt was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love\\nwith her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\\ndisappoint him—that Harriet’s nature should not be of that superior\\nsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there\\ncould be no necessity for any body’s knowing what had passed except the\\nthree principals, and especially for her father’s being given a\\nmoment’s uneasiness about it.\\n\\nThese were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of\\nsnow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome\\nthat might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\\n\\nThe weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\\ncould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No\\nintercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\\nSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\\nMr. Elton’s absenting himself.\\n\\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\\nthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\\nsociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well\\nsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\\nout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\\nentirely from them,—\\n\\n“Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?”\\n\\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes\\nof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still\\nsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,\\nas made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\\nweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\\nWoodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\\nbehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party set\\noff, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\\nIsabella;—which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\\non, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\\nbusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\\n\\nThe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\\nElton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\\nMr. Elton’s best compliments, “that he was proposing to leave Highbury\\nthe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the\\npressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\\nweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\\nvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\\nleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\\nretain a grateful sense—and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\\nhappy to attend to them.”\\n\\nEmma was most agreeably surprized.—Mr. Elton’s absence just at this\\ntime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\\nwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\\nin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\\nShe had not even a share in his opening compliments.—Her name was not\\nmentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\\nill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,\\nas she thought, at first, could not escape her father’s suspicion.\\n\\nIt did, however.—Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\\nsudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely\\nto the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was\\na very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\\nand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\\ntalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\\nwith all her usual promptitude.\\n\\nShe now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\\nto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable\\nthat she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\\nher other complaint before the gentleman’s return. She went to Mrs.\\nGoddard’s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\\npenance of communication; and a severe one it was.—She had to destroy\\nall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in\\nthe ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself\\ngrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\\nher observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\\nsix weeks.\\n\\nThe confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of\\nHarriet’s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\\nherself again.\\n\\nHarriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every\\nthing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\\nof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\\nher friend.\\n\\nEmma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\\nand all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\\nHarriet’s side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\\nany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\\nwould have been too great a distinction.—She never could have deserved\\nhim—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\\nhave thought it possible.\\n\\nHer tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless, that no\\ndignity could have made it more respectable in Emma’s eyes—and she\\nlistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\\nunderstanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\\nsuperior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for\\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence\\ncould do.\\n\\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father’s claims,\\nwas to promote Harriet’s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own\\naffection in some better method than by match-making. She got her to\\nHartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to\\noccupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton\\nfrom her thoughts.\\n\\nTime, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she\\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\\ngeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr.\\nElton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet’s\\nage, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might\\nbe made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton’s return,\\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of\\nacquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing\\nthem.\\n\\nHarriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did, in truth, prove\\nherself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it\\nappeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\\ninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend\\nits continuing very long in equal force.\\n\\nIf Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\\nindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\\nimagine Harriet’s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\\nrecollection of him.\\n\\nTheir being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\\neach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\\neffecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\\nother, and make the best of it.\\n\\nHarriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\\nGoddard’s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\\ngirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\\nhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\\nrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\\nfound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\\ncure, there could be no true peace for herself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,\\nMrs. Weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of\\nexcuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his “very great\\nmortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of\\ncoming to Randalls at no distant period.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in\\nfact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\\nhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\\nexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\\nany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\\nand begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\\nsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank’s coming two or three\\nmonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better\\nweather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\\nconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\\n\\nThese feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a\\nmore apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\\nexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\\nto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\\n\\nEmma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about\\nMr. Frank Churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at\\nRandalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,\\nrather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was\\ndesirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she\\ntook care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as\\nwarmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston’s disappointment, as might naturally\\nbelong to their friendship.\\n\\nShe was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\\nas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\\nmore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\\nuse of Mrs. Weston’s arguments against herself.\\n\\n“The Churchills are very likely in fault,” said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\\n“but I dare say he might come if he would.”\\n\\n“I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”\\n\\n“I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”\\n\\n“How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?”\\n\\n“I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\\nlittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\\nhave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural\\nthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\\nproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\\ntoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\\ncontrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is\\nhe?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as\\nmuch as that. It is impossible.”\\n\\n“That’s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\\nto manage.”\\n\\n“It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\\nmoney—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\\nother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\\nleave the Churchills.”\\n\\n“Yes, sometimes he can.”\\n\\n“And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.”\\n\\n“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct, without an intimate\\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\\nChurchill’s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\\nat others.”\\n\\n“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to his\\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of mere\\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—If he would say so to her at\\nonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\\nopposition made to his going.”\\n\\n“No,” said Emma, laughing; “but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\\nuse!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\\nhim!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\\nloud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?”\\n\\n“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of\\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do\\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\\npeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\\nlittle minds would bend to his.”\\n\\n“I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\\nto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill’s\\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\\nregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\\ncircumstances, to act up to it.”\\n\\n“Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.”\\n\\n“Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\\nlife.”\\n\\n“Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\\nwould have been no difficulty now.”\\n\\n“We shall never agree about him,” cried Emma; “but that is nothing\\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man’s\\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.”\\n\\n“Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father’s having any right\\nto complain. His letters disgust me.”\\n\\n“Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.”\\n\\n“I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s\\nplace, but without a mother’s affection to blind her. It is on her\\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\\ndid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\\nFrench, not in English. He may be very ‘amiable,’ have very good\\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy\\ntowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You seem determined to think ill of him.”\\n\\n“Me!—not at all,” replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; “I do not\\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\\nmerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\\nplausible manners.”\\n\\n“Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—one object of\\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\\nof nobody else.”\\n\\n“You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.”\\n\\n“My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all\\nsubjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\\njust as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\\nthat is my idea of him.”\\n\\n“And mine,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “is, that if he turn out any\\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the\\npractised politician, who is to read every body’s character, and make\\nevery body’s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\\nnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point.”\\n\\n“I will say no more about him,” cried Emma, “you turn every thing to\\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.”\\n\\n“Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.”\\n\\n“But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.”\\n\\n“He is a person I never think of from one month’s end to another,” said\\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should\\nbe angry.\\n\\nTo take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\\ndifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\\nmind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\\nhigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she\\nhad never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the\\nmerit of another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME II\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma’s\\nopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\\nnot think that Harriet’s solace or her own sins required more; and she\\nwas therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\\nreturned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\\nand after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,\\nand receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—“Mr. Elton is so\\ngood to the poor!” she found something else must be done.\\n\\nThey were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\\nShe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\\nalways sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\\nloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\\nwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\\nthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\\ntheir scanty comforts.\\n\\nShe had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\\nas to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\nof its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and all\\nthe horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\\nthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and\\ntherefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden\\nresolution of not passing their door without going in—observing, as she\\nproposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were\\njust now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\\n\\nThe house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\\nthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized\\napartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most\\ncordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who\\nwith her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to\\ngive up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking\\ndaughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks\\nfor their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after\\nMr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her mother’s, and\\nsweet-cake from the beaufet—“Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called\\nin for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them,\\nand _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she\\nliked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss\\nSmith would do them the favour to eat a piece too.”\\n\\nThe mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\\nThere was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\\nsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\\nletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\\nhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he\\nwent, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies’ ball had been; and she\\nwent through it very well, with all the interest and all the\\ncommendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to\\nprevent Harriet’s being obliged to say a word.\\n\\nThis she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\\nhaving once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\\nany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the\\nMistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not\\nbeen prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was\\nactually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last\\nabruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\\n\\n“Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing—Mrs. Cole was\\ntelling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was—Mrs. Cole was so kind\\nas to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she came\\nin, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a favourite\\nthere. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her\\nkindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any\\nbody can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, ‘I\\nknow you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time\\nfor writing;’ and when I immediately said, ‘But indeed we have, we had\\na letter this very morning,’ I do not know that I ever saw any body\\nmore surprized. ‘Have you, upon your honour?’ said she; ‘well, that is\\nquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.’”\\n\\nEmma’s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest—\\n\\n“Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\\nhope she is well?”\\n\\n“Thank you. You are so kind!” replied the happily deceived aunt, while\\neagerly hunting for the letter.—“Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\\nnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without\\nbeing aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very\\nlately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it\\nto Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my\\nmother, for it is such a pleasure to her—a letter from Jane—that she\\ncan never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and\\nhere it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to\\nwish to hear what she says;—but, first of all, I really must, in\\njustice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter—only two\\npages you see—hardly two—and in general she fills the whole paper and\\ncrosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.\\nShe often says, when the letter is first opened, ‘Well, Hetty, now I\\nthink you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’—don’t\\nyou, ma’am?—And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make\\nit out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her—every word of it—I\\nam sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And,\\nindeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she can\\nsee amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is\\nsuch a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often\\nsays, when she is here, ‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very\\nstrong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done\\ntoo!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’”\\n\\nAll this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\\nand Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\\nFairfax’s handwriting.\\n\\n“You are extremely kind,” replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; “you\\nwho are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure\\nthere is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss\\nWoodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know.\\nMa’am,” addressing her, “do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging\\nto say about Jane’s handwriting?”\\n\\nAnd Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\\ntwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\\npondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\\nrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax’s letter, and had almost\\nresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\\nBates turned to her again and seized her attention.\\n\\n“My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all. By\\nonly raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\\nshe is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\\nremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\\nJane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at\\nall deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at\\nmy mother’s time of life—and it really is full two years, you know,\\nsince she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before,\\nand as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough\\nof her now.”\\n\\n“Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?”\\n\\n“Oh yes; next week.”\\n\\n“Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure.”\\n\\n“Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\\nsurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\\nwill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\\nher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\\nCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So\\nvery good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you\\nknow. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about.\\nThat is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in\\nthe common course, we should not have heard from her before next\\nTuesday or Wednesday.”\\n\\n“Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\\nhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.”\\n\\n“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\\nfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\\nmother is so delighted!—for she is to be three months with us at least.\\nThree months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\\npleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells\\nare going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to\\ncome over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till\\nthe summer, but she is so impatient to see them again—for till she\\nmarried, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,\\nwhich must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was\\ngoing to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very\\nurgent letter to her mother—or her father, I declare I do not know\\nwhich it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr.\\nDixon’s name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,\\nand they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to\\ntheir country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has\\nheard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know\\nthat she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very\\nnatural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while\\nhe was paying his addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking\\nout with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about\\ntheir daughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I\\ndo not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be\\ntelling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she\\nwrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views\\nthat he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I\\nbelieve. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of\\nthings.”\\n\\nAt this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma’s\\nbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not\\ngoing to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\\ndiscovery,\\n\\n“You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\\ncome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\\nbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\\nexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\\n\\n“Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\\nrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\\ndistance from us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was\\nto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\\nher (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\\nCampbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\\nthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\\nMr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a\\nmost charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\\nWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by\\nthe sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would\\nhave been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone,\\nif he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her\\nhabit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we\\nhad the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!”\\n\\n“But, in spite of all her friends’ urgency, and her own wish of seeing\\nIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?”\\n\\n“Yes—entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and\\nMrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\\nrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\\nair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.”\\n\\n“I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\\nDixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no\\nremarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\\ncompared with Miss Fairfax.”\\n\\n“Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not.\\nThere is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was\\nabsolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable.”\\n\\n“Yes, that of course.”\\n\\n“Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of\\nNovember, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well\\nsince. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never\\nmentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\\nconsiderate!—But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\\nfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\\nthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\\nmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her—and it is certainly a great\\ndeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\\nunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.”\\n\\n“It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.”\\n\\n“And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\\nleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—as you will\\nfind from Jane’s letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhat a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\\nher illness—but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\\nlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\\nme, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through\\nto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\\nfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\\nto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\\nbut no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\\nburst out, quite frightened, with ‘Bless me! poor Jane is ill!’—which\\nmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\\nat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\\nfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\\nnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\\nguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\\nexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\\nfond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\\nattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife\\nand family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well,\\nnow I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will\\nturn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal\\nbetter than I can tell it for her.”\\n\\n“I am afraid we must be running away,” said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\\nand beginning to rise—“My father will be expecting us. I had no\\nintention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\\nwhen I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\\npass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\\npleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\\nmorning.”\\n\\nAnd not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained\\nthe street—happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\\nagainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\\nJane Fairfax’s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates’s youngest\\ndaughter.\\n\\nThe marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry, and Miss\\nJane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest;\\nbut nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him\\ndying in action abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief\\nsoon afterwards—and this girl.\\n\\nBy birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\\nlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the\\nconsolation, the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had\\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her\\nbeing taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up\\nwith no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\\nnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\\nwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\\n\\nBut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\\nto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\\nFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\\nfarther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\\ncamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\\nhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\\ndeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing\\nin his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took\\nnotice of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a\\ngirl, about Jane’s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long\\nvisits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years\\nold, his daughter’s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a\\nreal friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of\\nundertaking the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and\\nfrom that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell’s family, and\\nhad lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time\\nto time.\\n\\nThe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\\nvery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\\nindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of\\nColonel Campbell’s power; for though his income, by pay and\\nappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\\nhis daughter’s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\\nsupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\\n\\nSuch was Jane Fairfax’s history. She had fallen into good hands, known\\nnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\\neducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed\\npeople, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of\\ndiscipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell’s residence being in\\nLondon, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the\\nattendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were\\nequally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or\\nnineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\\ncare of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\\nbut she was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor\\nmother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil\\nday was put off. It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\\nand Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\\nrational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of\\nhome and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\\nsuggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this\\nmight soon be over.\\n\\nThe affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell\\nin particular, was the more honourable to each party from the\\ncircumstance of Jane’s decided superiority both in beauty and\\nacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\\nby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by\\nthe parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till\\nthe marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so\\noften defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to\\nwhat is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\\naffections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\\nsoon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\\nwhile Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\\n\\nThis event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\\nfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\\nshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\\nhad resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\\nfrom all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society,\\npeace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\\n\\nThe good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\\nresolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\\nexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\\nfor their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\\nwould be selfishness:—what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps\\nthey began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted\\nthe temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such\\nenjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still,\\nhowever, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not\\nhurrying on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since\\nthe time of their daughter’s marriage; and till she should have\\ncompletely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\\nin duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\\nand varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\\nto require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\\ndischarged with tolerable comfort.\\n\\nWith regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\\naunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not\\ntold. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\\nHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\\nthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\\nwhatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\\nor treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that\\nthey depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the\\nrecovery of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she\\nwas to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect\\nnovelty which had been so long promised it—Mr. Frank Churchill—must put\\nup for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the\\nfreshness of a two years’ absence.\\n\\nEmma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\\nthrough three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished, and\\nless than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\\ndifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\\nbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\\nwanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\\neagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\\nwhich her conscience could not quite acquit her. But “she could never\\nget acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\\nsuch coldness and reserve—such apparent indifference whether she\\npleased or not—and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!—and she\\nwas made such a fuss with by every body!—and it had been always\\nimagined that they were to be so intimate—because their ages were the\\nsame, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.”\\nThese were her reasons—she had no better.\\n\\nIt was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by\\nfancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\\nnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years’\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\\nmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\\nJane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\\nthe highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as\\nalmost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\\nher figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\\nbetween fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\\nto point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all\\nthis; and then, her face—her features—there was more beauty in them\\naltogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very\\npleasing beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\\neyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\\nhad been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\\ndelicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty,\\nof which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in\\nhonour, by all her principles, admire it:—elegance, which, whether of\\nperson or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be\\nvulgar, was distinction, and merit.\\n\\nIn short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\\ntwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\\njustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\\nshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\\nwhen she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she\\nwas going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\\nto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\\nwell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\\nprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so\\nnaturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\\npitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\\nEmma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon’s\\naffections from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her\\nimagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be\\nsimple, single, successless love on her side alone. She might have been\\nunconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\\nconversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\\nmight now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\\ndivide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\\nbeginning her career of laborious duty.\\n\\nUpon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that\\nshe could wish to scheme about for her.\\n\\nThese were charming feelings—but not lasting. Before she had committed\\nherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane\\nFairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\\nerrors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, “She certainly is handsome; she\\nis better than handsome!” Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\\nher grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\\nusual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome\\nas ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\\nadmiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\\nexactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\\nsmall a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\\nnew caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane’s\\noffences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\\nthanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\\naffectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\\nin higher style her own very superior performance. She was, besides,\\nwhich was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting\\nat her real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\\ndetermined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\\nreserved.\\n\\nIf any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved\\non the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed\\nbent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon’s character, or her own\\nvalue for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It\\nwas all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or\\ndistinguished. It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown\\naway. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There\\nprobably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr.\\nDixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other,\\nor been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve\\nthousand pounds.\\n\\nThe like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\\nhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\\nlittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was. “Was he handsome?”—“She believed he\\nwas reckoned a very fine young man.” “Was he agreeable?”—“He was\\ngenerally thought so.” “Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man\\nof information?”—“At a watering-place, or in a common London\\nacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\\nall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\\nthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\\nmanners pleasing.” Emma could not forgive her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nEmma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\\nexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\\nMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\\nhave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain\\nenough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her\\nunjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\\n\\n“A very pleasant evening,” he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\\ntalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\\nswept away;—“particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\\nvery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than\\nsitting at one’s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such\\nyoung women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am\\nsure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left\\nnothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no\\ninstrument at her grandmother’s, it must have been a real indulgence.”\\n\\n“I am happy you approved,” said Emma, smiling; “but I hope I am not\\noften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.”\\n\\n“No, my dear,” said her father instantly; “_that_ I am sure you are\\nnot. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any\\nthing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night—if it had been\\nhanded round once, I think it would have been enough.”\\n\\n“No,” said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; “you are not often\\ndeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\\nthink you understand me, therefore.”\\n\\nAn arch look expressed—“I understand you well enough;” but she said\\nonly, “Miss Fairfax is reserved.”\\n\\n“I always told you she was—a little; but you will soon overcome all\\nthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\\nfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be\\nhonoured.”\\n\\n“You think her diffident. I do not see it.”\\n\\n“My dear Emma,” said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\\n“you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\\nevening.”\\n\\n“Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\\nand amused to think how little information I obtained.”\\n\\n“I am disappointed,” was his only answer.\\n\\n“I hope every body had a pleasant evening,” said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\\nquiet way. “I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\\nmoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\\nMiss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\\nshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\\nBates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\\nFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very\\nwell-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\\nagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.”\\n\\n“True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.”\\n\\nEmma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\\npresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question—\\n\\n“She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one’s eyes\\nfrom. I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my\\nheart.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\\nexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\\nthoughts were on the Bates’s, said—\\n\\n“It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\\ngreat pity indeed! and I have often wished—but it is so little one can\\nventure to do—small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon—Now we\\nhave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\\nit is very small and delicate—Hartfield pork is not like any other\\npork—but still it is pork—and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\\nof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,\\nwithout the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear\\nroast pork—I think we had better send the leg—do not you think so, my\\ndear?”\\n\\n“My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\\nThere will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.”\\n\\n“That’s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\\nthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\\nis not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\\nboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\\nlittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.”\\n\\n“Emma,” said Mr. Knightley presently, “I have a piece of news for you.\\nYou like news—and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\\ninterest you.”\\n\\n“News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?—why do you smile\\nso?—where did you hear it?—at Randalls?”\\n\\nHe had time only to say,\\n\\n“No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,” when the door was\\nthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\\nof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give\\nquickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that\\nnot another syllable of communication could rest with him.\\n\\n“Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse—I\\ncome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are\\ntoo bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\\nmarried.”\\n\\nEmma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\\ncompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\\nlittle blush, at the sound.\\n\\n“There is my news:—I thought it would interest you,” said Mr.\\nKnightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\\nhad passed between them.\\n\\n“But where could _you_ hear it?” cried Miss Bates. “Where could you\\npossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\\nreceived Mrs. Cole’s note—no, it cannot be more than five—or at least\\nten—for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out—I\\nwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork—Jane was\\nstanding in the passage—were not you, Jane?—for my mother was so afraid\\nthat we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down\\nand see, and Jane said, ‘Shall I go down instead? for I think you have\\na little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.’—‘Oh! my dear,’\\nsaid I—well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins—that’s all I\\nknow. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you\\npossibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of\\nit, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins—”\\n\\n“I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\\nread Elton’s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.”\\n\\n“Well! that is quite—I suppose there never was a piece of news more\\ngenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\\nmother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\\nthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.”\\n\\n“We consider our Hartfield pork,” replied Mr. Woodhouse—“indeed it\\ncertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\\ncannot have a greater pleasure than—”\\n\\n“Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to\\nus. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\\nthemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We\\nmay well say that ‘our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.’ Well, Mr.\\nKnightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well—”\\n\\n“It was short—merely to announce—but cheerful, exulting, of course.”—\\nHere was a sly glance at Emma. “He had been so fortunate as to—I forget\\nthe precise words—one has no business to remember them. The information\\nwas, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins.\\nBy his style, I should imagine it just settled.”\\n\\n“Mr. Elton going to be married!” said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\\n“He will have every body’s wishes for his happiness.”\\n\\n“He is very young to settle,” was Mr. Woodhouse’s observation. “He had\\nbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\\nwere always glad to see him at Hartfield.”\\n\\n“A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!” said Miss Bates,\\njoyfully; “my mother is so pleased!—she says she cannot bear to have\\nthe poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed.\\nJane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!—no wonder that you have such a\\ncuriosity to see him.”\\n\\nJane’s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\\noccupy her.\\n\\n“No—I have never seen Mr. Elton,” she replied, starting on this appeal;\\n“is he—is he a tall man?”\\n\\n“Who shall answer that question?” cried Emma. “My father would say\\n‘yes,’ Mr. Knightley ‘no;’ and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\\nhappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\\nyou will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\\nHighbury, both in person and mind.”\\n\\n“Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\\nman—But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was\\nprecisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,—I dare say, an\\nexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother—wanting her\\nto sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\\nmother is a little deaf, you know—it is not much, but she does not hear\\nquite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\\nfancied bathing might be good for it—the warm bath—but she says it did\\nhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\\nAnd Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\\nis such a happiness when good people get together—and they always do.\\nNow, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\\nsuch very good people; and the Perrys—I suppose there never was a\\nhappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,”\\nturning to Mr. Woodhouse, “I think there are few places with such\\nsociety as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our\\nneighbours.—My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better\\nthan another, it is pork—a roast loin of pork—”\\n\\n“As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\\nwith her,” said Emma, “nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that\\nit cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four\\nweeks.”\\n\\nNobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\\nEmma said,\\n\\n“You are silent, Miss Fairfax—but I hope you mean to take an interest\\nin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on\\nthese subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\\nCampbell’s account—we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\\nElton and Miss Hawkins.”\\n\\n“When I have seen Mr. Elton,” replied Jane, “I dare say I shall be\\ninterested—but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\\nmonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\\noff.”\\n\\n“Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss\\nWoodhouse,” said Miss Bates, “four weeks yesterday.—A Miss\\nHawkins!—Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady\\nhereabouts; not that I ever—Mrs. Cole once whispered to me—but I\\nimmediately said, ‘No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man—but’—In\\nshort, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of\\ndiscoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the\\nsame time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired—Miss\\nWoodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not\\noffend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered\\nnow. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear\\nlittle children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr.\\nJohn Knightley. I mean in person—tall, and with that sort of look—and\\nnot very talkative.”\\n\\n“Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.”\\n\\n“Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\\nOne takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\\nnot, strictly speaking, handsome?”\\n\\n“Handsome! Oh! no—far from it—certainly plain. I told you he was\\nplain.”\\n\\n“My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\\nand that you yourself—”\\n\\n“Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I\\nalways think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\\ngeneral opinion, when I called him plain.”\\n\\n“Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather\\ndoes not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging,\\nmy dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a\\nmost agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs.\\nCole’s; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better\\ngo home directly—I would not have you out in a shower!—We think she is\\nthe better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\\nattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares\\nfor any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be\\nanother thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is\\ncoming too. Well, that is so very!—I am sure if Jane is tired, you will\\nbe so kind as to give her your arm.—Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!—Good\\nmorning to you.”\\n\\nEmma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\\nhe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to\\nmarry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view\\nof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\\nof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but\\nshe was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that she could\\nhope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from\\nhearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was\\nlikely to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its\\nbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\\ndetaining her at Mrs. Goddard’s, and that the intelligence would\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\\n\\nThe shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\\nwhen in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the “Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!” which instantly burst\\nforth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow\\nwas given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than\\nin listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had\\nto tell. “She had set out from Mrs. Goddard’s half an hour ago—she had\\nbeen afraid it would rain—she had been afraid it would pour down every\\nmoment—but she thought she might get to Hartfield first—she had hurried\\non as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where\\na young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just\\nstep in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay\\nhalf a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she\\ndid not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could,\\nand took shelter at Ford’s.”—Ford’s was the principal woollen-draper,\\nlinen-draper, and haberdasher’s shop united; the shop first in size and\\nfashion in the place.—“And so, there she had set, without an idea of\\nany thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps—when, all of a\\nsudden, who should come in—to be sure it was so very odd!—but they\\nalways dealt at Ford’s—who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her\\nbrother!—Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have\\nfainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the\\ndoor—Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the\\numbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took\\nno notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and\\nI kept sitting near the door!—Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I\\nmust have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know,\\nbecause of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but\\nthere.—Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse—well, at last, I fancy, he looked round\\nand saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they began\\nwhispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I\\ncould not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me—(do\\nyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)—for presently she came forward—came\\nquite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake\\nhands, if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she\\nused; I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to\\nbe very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but\\nI know no more what I said—I was in such a tremble!—I remember she said\\nshe was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear,\\nMiss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was\\nbeginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me\\nfrom getting away—and then—only think!—I found he was coming up towards\\nme too—slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\\nso he came and spoke, and I answered—and I stood for a minute, feeling\\ndreadfully, you know, one can’t tell how; and then I took courage, and\\nsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not\\ngot three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I\\nwas going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr.\\nCole’s stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this\\nrain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I\\nsaid, I was very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and\\nthen he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables—I\\nbelieve I did—but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh!\\nMiss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and\\nyet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so\\npleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do\\ntalk to me and make me comfortable again.”\\n\\nVery sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\\nher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\\ncomfortable herself. The young man’s conduct, and his sister’s, seemed\\nthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\\ndescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded\\naffection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed\\nthem to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did\\nthis make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed\\nby it. Of course, he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry.\\nAmbition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all\\nhave hoped to rise by Harriet’s acquaintance: and besides, what was the\\nvalue of Harriet’s description?—So easily pleased—so little\\ndiscerning;—what signified her praise?\\n\\nShe exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by\\nconsidering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of\\nbeing dwelt on,\\n\\n“It might be distressing, for the moment,” said she; “but you seem to\\nhave behaved extremely well; and it is over—and may never—can never, as\\na first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\\nit.”\\n\\nHarriet said, “very true,” and she “would not think about it;” but\\nstill she talked of it—still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma,\\nat last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to\\nhurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender\\ncaution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed\\nor only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet—such a\\nconclusion of Mr. Elton’s importance with her!\\n\\nMr. Elton’s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\\nthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an\\nhour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first\\nconversation was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations\\nof curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this\\nfortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under\\nproper subordination in her fancy.\\n\\nEmma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\\nhad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining\\nany influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\\nat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\\ncourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\\nbrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard’s; and a\\ntwelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with\\nany necessity, or even any power of speech.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\\nsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\\nbeing kindly spoken of.\\n\\nA week had not passed since Miss Hawkins’s name was first mentioned in\\nHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\\nevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant,\\nhighly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself\\narrived to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of\\nher merits, there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her\\nChristian name, and say whose music she principally played.\\n\\nMr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\\nmortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\\nappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\\nlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\\nhad gone away deeply offended—he came back engaged to another—and to\\nanother as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\\ncircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back\\ngay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss\\nWoodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.\\n\\nThe charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages\\nof perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent\\nfortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of\\nsome dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had\\nnot thrown himself away—he had gained a woman of 10,000 _l_. or\\nthereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity—the\\nfirst hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\\ndistinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of\\nthe rise and progress of the affair was so glorious—the steps so quick,\\nfrom the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green’s, and the\\nparty at Mrs. Brown’s—smiles and blushes rising in importance—with\\nconsciousness and agitation richly scattered—the lady had been so\\neasily impressed—so sweetly disposed—had in short, to use a most\\nintelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him, that vanity and\\nprudence were equally contented.\\n\\nHe had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection, and\\nwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his\\nown concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed at—and,\\nwith cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of\\nthe place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more cautiously\\ngallant.\\n\\nThe wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\\nplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\\nwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\\na certain glance of Mrs. Cole’s did not seem to contradict, that when\\nhe next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\\n\\nDuring his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just\\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the\\nimpression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and\\npretension, now spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very\\nmuch to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his\\nsight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable\\nfeelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a\\nsource of profitable humiliation to her own mind, she would have been\\nthankful to be assured of never seeing him again. She wished him very\\nwell; but he gave her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would\\nadminister most satisfaction.\\n\\nThe pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\\ncertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\\nprevented—many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would be\\nan excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\\nwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\\nagain.\\n\\nOf the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good\\nenough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for\\nHighbury—handsome enough—to look plain, probably, by Harriet’s side. As\\nto connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all\\nhis own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On\\nthat article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be\\nuncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the\\n10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet’s superior.\\nShe brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the\\nyoungest of the two daughters of a Bristol—merchant, of course, he must\\nbe called; but, as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life\\nappeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of\\nhis line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she\\nhad been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home, the very\\nheart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years\\nago, an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly\\nhonourable was hazarded of him, than that he was in the law line; and\\nwith him the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him to be the drudge of\\nsome attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the\\nconnexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was _very_ _well_\\n_married_, to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_, near Bristol, who kept\\ntwo carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory\\nof Miss Hawkins.\\n\\nCould she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\\ntalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\\nof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet’s\\nmind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\\ncertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\\nwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\\nher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\\nin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\\nreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\\nsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times\\nevery day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss\\nhim, _just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have\\nsomething occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring\\nwarmth of surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually\\nhearing about him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always\\namong those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so\\ninteresting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report,\\ntherefore, every guess—all that had already occurred, all that might\\noccur in the arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income,\\nservants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her\\nregard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her\\nregrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of\\nMiss Hawkins’s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he\\nseemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of\\nhis hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\\n\\nHad it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\\nfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet’s mind,\\nEmma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\\npredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\\nas a check to the other. Mr. Elton’s engagement had been the cure of\\nthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\\nknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\\nMartin’s calling at Mrs. Goddard’s a few days afterwards. Harriet had\\nnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her,\\nwritten in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a\\ngreat deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had\\nbeen much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done\\nin return, and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr.\\nElton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the\\nMartins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for\\nBath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,\\njudged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin’s visit.\\n\\nHow that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and what\\nmight be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\\nAbsolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\\nbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\\nacquaintance—!\\n\\nAfter much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\\nHarriet’s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\\nunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\\nacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\\nAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so\\nsoon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\nrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\\nof intimacy was chosen for the future.\\n\\nShe could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\\nwhich her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude, merely\\nglossed over—it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\\nfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard’s, her evil stars had led her to\\nthe very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\\nPhilip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\\nbeing lifted into the butcher’s cart, which was to convey it to where\\nthe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\\nand the direction, was consequently a blank.\\n\\nShe went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\\nput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\\nespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\\nhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\\nrevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed\\nher to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which\\ndetermined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of\\nan hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old\\nservant who was married, and settled in Donwell.\\n\\nThe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\\nand Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\\nunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\\ngravel walk—a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\\nher seemingly with ceremonious civility.\\n\\nHarriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\\nfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\\nunderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\\nShe had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\\ndoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace\\nhad been talked almost all the time—till just at last, when Mrs.\\nMartin’s saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was\\ngrown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.\\nIn that very room she had been measured last September, with her two\\nfriends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot\\nby the window. _He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day,\\nthe hour, the party, the occasion—to feel the same consciousness, the\\nsame regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and\\nthey were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must\\nsuspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when\\nthe carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and\\nthe shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to\\nbe given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six\\nmonths ago!—Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they\\nmight resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business.\\nShe would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\\nthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\\n_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\\nhave done otherwise?—Impossible!—She could not repent. They must be\\nseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to\\nherself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\\nconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure\\nit. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\\nrefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\\n\\nIt was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that\\nneither “master nor mistress was at home;” they had both been out some\\ntime; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\\n\\n“This is too bad,” cried Emma, as they turned away. “And now we shall\\njust miss them; too provoking!—I do not know when I have been so\\ndisappointed.” And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\\nmurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both—such being\\nthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the\\ncarriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who\\nwere standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight\\nof them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for Mr.\\nWeston immediately accosted her with,\\n\\n“How d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—We have been sitting with your father—glad\\nto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow—I had a letter this\\nmorning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at\\nOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\\nso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\\nwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\\njust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\\nenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\\nwish.”\\n\\nThere was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\\ninfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston’s, confirmed as it all was\\nby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but\\nnot less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain\\nwas enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice\\nin their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted\\nspirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was\\ncoming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s thought, she hoped Mr.\\nElton would now be talked of no more.\\n\\nMr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\\nallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his\\ncommand, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she\\nlistened, and smiled, and congratulated.\\n\\n“I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.\\n\\nEmma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\\nwife.\\n\\n“We had better move on, Mr. Weston,” said she, “we are detaining the\\ngirls.”\\n\\n“Well, well, I am ready;”—and turning again to Emma, “but you must not\\nbe expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\\naccount you know; I dare say he is really nothing\\nextraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\\nspeaking a very different conviction.\\n\\nEmma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\\nmanner that appropriated nothing.\\n\\n“Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o’clock,” was Mrs.\\nWeston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\\nfor her.\\n\\n“Four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three,” was Mr.\\nWeston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\\nEmma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a\\ndifferent air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\\nbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\\nmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\\nsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\\n\\n“Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?”—was a\\nquestion, however, which did not augur much.\\n\\nBut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\\nwas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\\n\\nThe morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston’s faithful\\npupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that\\nshe was to think of her at four.\\n\\n“My dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental soliloquy, while\\nwalking downstairs from her own room, “always overcareful for every\\nbody’s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\\ngoing again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.” The\\nclock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. “’Tis twelve; I\\nshall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time\\nto-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\\npossibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\\nsoon.”\\n\\nShe opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\\nfather—Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\\nminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of\\nFrank’s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the\\nmidst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,\\nto have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\\n\\nThe Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was\\nactually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think too\\nmuch had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young\\nman; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his\\ncountenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his\\nfather’s; he looked quick and sensible. She felt immediately that she\\nshould like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a\\nreadiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be\\nacquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\\n\\nHe had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\\neagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\\nearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\\n\\n“I told you yesterday,” cried Mr. Weston with exultation, “I told you\\nall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\\nused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\\ngetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\\nupon one’s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\\nmore than any little exertion it needs.”\\n\\n“It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the young\\nman, “though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\\nbut in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.”\\n\\nThe word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\\nEmma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\\nconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\\nwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\\nallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\\nHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\\nto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\\none’s _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\\nhe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\\npassed suspiciously through Emma’s brain; but still, if it were a\\nfalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner\\nhad no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if\\nin a state of no common enjoyment.\\n\\nTheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\\nacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,—“Was she a\\nhorsewoman?—Pleasant rides?—Pleasant walks?—Had they a large\\nneighbourhood?—Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?—There were\\nseveral very pretty houses in and about it.—Balls—had they balls?—Was\\nit a musical society?”\\n\\nBut when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\\ntheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\\nmother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so\\nmuch warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured\\nto his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an\\nadditional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly\\nthinking it worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word\\nof praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.\\nWeston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He\\nunderstood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “His\\nfather’s marriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend\\nmust rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a\\nblessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest\\nobligation on him.”\\n\\nHe got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor’s merits,\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\nwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse’s\\ncharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor’s. And at last, as if\\nresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\\nobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\\nher person.\\n\\n“Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,” said he; “but I\\nconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\\nvery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\\nI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.”\\n\\n“You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,”\\nsaid Emma; “were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\\nwith pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\\nsuch words. Don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a\\npretty young woman.”\\n\\n“I hope I should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a\\ngallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I\\nmight praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\\nterms.”\\n\\nEmma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\\ntheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her\\nmind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be\\nconsidered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must\\nsee more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they\\nwere agreeable.\\n\\nShe had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\\neye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\\nexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she\\nwas confident that he was often listening.\\n\\nHer own father’s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\\nentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\\nwas a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\\napproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—Though always objecting to\\nevery marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from the\\napprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any\\ntwo persons’ understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\\nwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\\nnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\\nglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\\nhis natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\\nFrank Churchill’s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\\nof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\\nanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which,\\nhowever, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\\nafter another night.\\n\\nA reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.—“He must be going.\\nHe had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\\nfor Mrs. Weston at Ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” His\\nson, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\\n\\n“As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\\nof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\\nmay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a\\nneighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\\nHighbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\\nI suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the\\nproper name—I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\\nfamily of that name?”\\n\\n“To be sure we do,” cried his father; “Mrs. Bates—we passed her house—I\\nsaw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss\\nFairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl she is.\\nCall upon her, by all means.”\\n\\n“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said the young\\nman; “another day would do as well; but there was that degree of\\nacquaintance at Weymouth which—”\\n\\n“Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\\ncannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\\nany want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You\\nsaw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she\\nmixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely\\nenough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.”\\n\\nThe son looked convinced.\\n\\n“I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,” said Emma; “she is a very\\nelegant young woman.”\\n\\nHe agreed to it, but with so quiet a “Yes,” as inclined her almost to\\ndoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\\nof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\\nonly ordinarily gifted with it.\\n\\n“If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,” said\\nshe, “I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her\\nand hear her—no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has\\nan aunt who never holds her tongue.”\\n\\n“You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?” said Mr.\\nWoodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; “then give\\nme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\\nlady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\\nworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\\nglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\\nshew you the way.”\\n\\n“My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.”\\n\\n“But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\\nquite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\\nhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\\nunless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\\nhad best cross the street.”\\n\\nMr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out, “My good friend,\\nthis is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\\nit, and as to Mrs. Bates’s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\\nstep, and jump.”\\n\\nThey were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\\ngraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma\\nremained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and\\ncould now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day,\\nwith full confidence in their comfort.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\\nWeston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He\\nhad been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,\\ntill her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their\\nwalk, immediately fixed on Highbury.—“He did not doubt there being very\\npleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\\nchuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\\nwould be his constant attraction.”—Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\\nfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction\\nwith him. They walked thither directly.\\n\\nEmma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\\nhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\\nnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\\ntherefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\\narm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\\ncompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\\nwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\\nfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\\nwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid\\nhis duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole\\nmanner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of\\nconsidering her as a friend and securing her affection. And there was\\ntime enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit\\nincluded all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about\\ntogether for an hour or two—first round the shrubberies of Hartfield,\\nand afterwards in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired\\nHartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse’s ear; and when their going\\nfarther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with\\nthe whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much\\noftener than Emma could have supposed.\\n\\nSome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\\nbegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\\nwhich had been the home of his father’s father; and on recollecting\\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\\nsome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\\nshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\\nbe very like a merit to those he was with.\\n\\nEmma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\\ncould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\\nabsenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a\\nparade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had\\nnot done him justice.\\n\\nTheir first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\\nthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\\nwere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\\nrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\\nany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\\nthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a\\nball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\\npopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;—but such\\nbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\\nwhich it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\\namong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\\ninterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\\npassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\\nwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\\nand lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no\\nfault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No,\\nit was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\\nvery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\\nfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the\\nformer good old days of the room?—She who could do any thing in\\nHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\\nto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\\npersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\\nnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when\\nparticulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling\\nto admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing,\\nor that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s\\nreturning into their proper place the next morning. He argued like a\\nyoung man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to\\nsee the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the\\nhabits of the Churchills. He seemed to have all the life and spirit,\\ncheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing\\nof the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was,\\nperhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank,\\nbordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge, however,\\nof the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively\\nspirits.\\n\\nAt last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and\\nbeing now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\\nrecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\\npaid it.\\n\\n“Yes, oh! yes”—he replied; “I was just going to mention it. A very\\nsuccessful visit:—I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\\nobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\\nme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\\nwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\\nwould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper;\\nand I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him—but\\nthere was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I\\nfound, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that\\nI had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an\\nhour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”\\n\\n“And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?”\\n\\n“Ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\\nill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\\nLadies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\\npale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—A most\\ndeplorable want of complexion.”\\n\\nEmma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\\nFairfax’s complexion. “It was certainly never brilliant, but she would\\nnot allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness\\nand delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character\\nof her face.” He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he\\nhad heard many people say the same—but yet he must confess, that to him\\nnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.\\nWhere features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them\\nall; and where they were good, the effect was—fortunately he need not\\nattempt to describe what the effect was.\\n\\n“Well,” said Emma, “there is no disputing about taste.—At least you\\nadmire her except her complexion.”\\n\\nHe shook his head and laughed.—“I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\\ncomplexion.”\\n\\n“Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same\\nsociety?”\\n\\nAt this moment they were approaching Ford’s, and he hastily exclaimed,\\n“Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\\ntheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\\nsays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford’s. If\\nit be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\\nmyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\\nbuy something at Ford’s. It will be taking out my freedom.—I dare say\\nthey sell gloves.”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\\nbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\\nyou were Mr. Weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at Ford’s, and your\\npopularity will stand upon your own virtues.”\\n\\nThey went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “Men’s Beavers”\\nand “York Tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\\nsaid—“But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\\nyou were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\\n_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\\npublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\\nprivate life.”\\n\\n“I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\\nparty at Weymouth.”\\n\\n“And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\\nvery unfair one. It is always the lady’s right to decide on the degree\\nof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.—I\\nshall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.”\\n\\n“Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\\nher account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\\nreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\\nbody, that I really think you may say what you like of your\\nacquaintance with her.”\\n\\n“May I, indeed?—Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\\nwell. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\\nlittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\\nColonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\\nwarm-hearted woman. I like them all.”\\n\\n“You know Miss Fairfax’s situation in life, I conclude; what she is\\ndestined to be?”\\n\\n“Yes—(rather hesitatingly)—I believe I do.”\\n\\n“You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,” said Mrs. Weston smiling;\\n“remember that I am here.—Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\\nwhen you speak of Miss Fairfax’s situation in life. I will move a\\nlittle farther off.”\\n\\n“I certainly do forget to think of _her_,” said Emma, “as having ever\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”\\n\\nHe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\\n\\nWhen the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “Did\\nyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?” said Frank\\nChurchill.\\n\\n“Ever hear her!” repeated Emma. “You forget how much she belongs to\\nHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\\nShe plays charmingly.”\\n\\n“You think so, do you?—I wanted the opinion of some one who could\\nreally judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\\nconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.—I am\\nexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of\\njudging of any body’s performance.—I have been used to hear her’s\\nadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:—a\\nman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman—engaged to\\nher—on the point of marriage—would yet never ask that other woman to\\nsit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\\ninstead—never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\\nThat, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.”\\n\\n“Proof indeed!” said Emma, highly amused.—“Mr. Dixon is very musical,\\nis he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\\nthan Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.”\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\\nvery strong proof.”\\n\\n“Certainly—very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\\nthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\\nto me. I could not excuse a man’s having more music than love—more ear\\nthan eye—a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\\nHow did Miss Campbell appear to like it?”\\n\\n“It was her very particular friend, you know.”\\n\\n“Poor comfort!” said Emma, laughing. “One would rather have a stranger\\npreferred than one’s very particular friend—with a stranger it might\\nnot recur again—but the misery of having a very particular friend\\nalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!—Poor\\nMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.”\\n\\n“You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\\nreally did not seem to feel it.”\\n\\n“So much the better—or so much the worse:—I do not know which. But be\\nit sweetness or be it stupidity in her—quickness of friendship, or\\ndulness of feeling—there was one person, I think, who must have felt\\nit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\\ndistinction.”\\n\\n“As to that—I do not—”\\n\\n“Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax’s\\nsensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\\nbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\\nwas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.”\\n\\n“There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all—” he\\nbegan rather quickly, but checking himself, added, “however, it is\\nimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were—how it might\\nall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\\noutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a\\nbetter judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\\nherself in critical situations, than I can be.”\\n\\n“I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and\\nwomen together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\\nintimate,—that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\\nher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\\nlittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to\\ntake disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always\\nwas, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her\\nreserve—I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.”\\n\\n“It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,” said he. “Oftentimes very\\nconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\\nbut no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.”\\n\\n“Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\\nmay be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\\nagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\\nconquering any body’s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\\nFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\\nill of her—not the least—except that such extreme and perpetual\\ncautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\\nabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something\\nto conceal.”\\n\\nHe perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\\nthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He\\nwas not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in\\nsome of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore\\nbetter than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate—his\\nfeelings warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of\\nconsidering Mr. Elton’s house, which, as well as the church, he would\\ngo and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No,\\nhe could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to\\nbe pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved,\\nhe could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There\\nmust be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a\\nblockhead who wanted more.\\n\\nMrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking\\nabout. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking\\nhow many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he\\ncould be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small\\none. But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he\\nwas talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to\\nsettle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not\\nbe aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no\\nhousekeeper’s room, or a bad butler’s pantry, but no doubt he did\\nperfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy, and that\\nwhenever he were attached, he would willingly give up much of wealth to\\nbe allowed an early establishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nEmma’s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\\nfollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to\\nhave his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at\\nbreakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to\\nreturn to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than\\nhaving his hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his travelling\\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of\\nfoppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. It did not\\naccord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even\\nthe unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to\\ndiscern in him yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change,\\nrestlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;\\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,\\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became\\nliable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and\\nthought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was\\nclear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making\\nno other comment than that “all young people would have their little\\nwhims.”\\n\\nWith the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was\\nvery ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\\nhimself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\\nappeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and\\nlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great\\ndeal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond\\nof talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were\\nleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\\nacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\\nspeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\\nsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\\ndenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\\nhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of\\nbeing at least very near it, and saved only by her own\\nindifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the\\nhonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nMr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have\\nsome weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\\nextremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\\nmuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\\nharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, “all young people would have their\\nlittle whims.”\\n\\nThere was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\\nleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes\\nof Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were\\nmade for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who\\nsmiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them\\nnot to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles—Mr.\\nKnightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,\\nhe was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to\\nhimself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, “Hum! just the trifling,\\nsilly fellow I took him for.” She had half a mind to resent; but an\\ninstant’s observation convinced her that it was really said only to\\nrelieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she\\nlet it pass.\\n\\nAlthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly\\nopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make\\nEmma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted\\nexactly the advice they gave.\\n\\nThis was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in\\nHighbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and\\nunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in\\ntrade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the\\ncountry, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping\\nlittle company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two\\nhad brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had\\nyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.\\nWith their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,\\ntheir inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their\\nnumber of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time\\nwere, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at\\nHartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared\\nevery body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly\\namong the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best\\nfamilies Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither\\nDonwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go,\\nif they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be\\ngiving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were\\nvery respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was\\nnot for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would\\nvisit them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only\\nfrom herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\\n\\nBut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\\nbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\\nvery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\\ninvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\\nWeston’s accounting for it with “I suppose they will not take the\\nliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite\\nsufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\\nrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled\\nthere, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,\\noccurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been\\ntempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the\\nBateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the\\nday before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her\\nabsence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of\\nhis. The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her\\nspirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the\\nomission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\\n\\nIt was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\\nHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\\nfirst remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,”\\nshe so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\\n\\nShe owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without\\ninclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\\nproperly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much\\nconsideration for her father. “They would have solicited the honour\\nearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\\nLondon, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\\nair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\\nof his company.” Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\\nbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without\\nneglecting his comfort—how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,\\nmight be depended on for bearing him company—Mr. Woodhouse was to be\\ntalked into an acquiescence of his daughter’s going out to dinner on a\\nday now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As\\nfor _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours\\nwould be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well\\nresigned.\\n\\n“I am not fond of dinner-visiting,” said he—“I never was. No more is\\nEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\\nshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\\nin one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us—take us in\\ntheir afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\\nreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\\nevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\\nbody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\\nwith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to\\ntake care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be\\nwhat it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.” Then turning to Mrs.\\nWeston, with a look of gentle reproach—“Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\\nmarried, you would have staid at home with me.”\\n\\n“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\\nincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\\nGoddard in a moment, if you wish it.”\\n\\nBut the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not\\nlessening, Mr. Woodhouse’s agitation. The ladies knew better how to\\nallay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\\narranged.\\n\\nWith this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\\nas usual. “He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great\\nregard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her.\\nJames could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer\\nwritten to Mrs. Cole.”\\n\\n“You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will\\nsay that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must\\ndecline their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of\\ncourse. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is\\nto be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will\\nbe wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have\\nnever been there above once since the new approach was made; but still\\nI have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get\\nthere, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you\\nagain; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying\\nlate. You will get very tired when tea is over.”\\n\\n“But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?”\\n\\n“Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great\\nmany people talking at once. You will not like the noise.”\\n\\n“But, my dear sir,” cried Mr. Weston, “if Emma comes away early, it\\nwill be breaking up the party.”\\n\\n“And no great harm if it does,” said Mr. Woodhouse. “The sooner every\\nparty breaks up, the better.”\\n\\n“But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma’s going\\naway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\\npeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel\\nthat any body’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\\nWoodhouse’s doing it would be more thought of than any other person’s\\nin the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I\\nam sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\\nbeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.”\\n\\n“No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you\\nfor reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\\npain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\\nnever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\\nhe is bilious—Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of\\ngiving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\\nrather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\\nlittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\\nwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.”\\n\\n“Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\\nscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\\nonly afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not\\nbeing exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\\nknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\\nyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of\\nthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\\nup.”\\n\\nHe did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if\\nshe came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\\nhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\\nsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\\nthing were safe in the house, as usual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner\\nwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\\nfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any\\nimperfection which could be concealed.\\n\\nHe came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\\ngood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\\ndone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any\\nconfusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his\\nspirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after\\nseeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:—\\n\\n“I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do\\ncease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\\nway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.—It\\ndepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\\n_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\\ndifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been\\nashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a\\ncoxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\\nvanities.—No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.”\\n\\nWith Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a\\nlonger time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\\ninference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\\nhow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\\nand of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\\nnow seeing them together for the first time.\\n\\nShe meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\\nCole’s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\\nElton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\\nhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\\n\\nHer father’s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\\nGoddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\\nthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\\ndinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\\ndress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\\nthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\\nunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\\nthem to practise during the meal.—She had provided a plentiful dinner\\nfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\\nit.\\n\\nShe followed another carriage to Mr. Cole’s door; and was pleased to\\nsee that it was Mr. Knightley’s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\\nhaving little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\\nindependence, was too apt, in Emma’s opinion, to get about as he could,\\nand not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\\nShe had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\\nher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\\n\\n“This is coming as you should do,” said she; “like a gentleman.—I am\\nquite glad to see you.”\\n\\nHe thanked her, observing, “How lucky that we should arrive at the same\\nmoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.—You\\nmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.”\\n\\n“Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\\nbeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\\nwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I\\nalways observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_\\nyou have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed\\nashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_\\nI shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.”\\n\\n“Nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.\\n\\nEmma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\\nwith Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\\nnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When\\nthe Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\\nadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\\nher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\\nand at dinner she found him seated by her—and, as she firmly believed,\\nnot without some dexterity on his side.\\n\\nThe party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\\nunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\\nnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox’s family,\\nthe lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\\nevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at\\ndinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\\ngeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\\nfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her\\nneighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to\\nattend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating\\nsomething of her that was expected to be very interesting. She\\nlistened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of\\nEmma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that\\nshe had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room\\nhad been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking\\ninstrument—not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\\nsubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\\nsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and\\nexplanations on Miss Bates’s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived\\nfrom Broadwood’s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt\\nand niece—entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates’s account,\\nJane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\\npossibly have ordered it—but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\\nthat it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from\\nColonel Campbell.\\n\\n“One can suppose nothing else,” added Mrs. Cole, “and I was only\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\\nhad a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\\nShe knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\\nany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\\nto surprize her.”\\n\\nMrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\\nenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\\nlisten to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\n“I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\\nmore satisfaction!—It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\\nplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a\\nshame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\\ninstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a\\nslap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I\\nreally was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\\ndrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\\ngirls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\\nit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\\nspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.—I was saying this to Mr.\\nCole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\\nparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in\\nthe purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\\nobliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\\nreally is the reason why the instrument was bought—or else I am sure we\\nought to be ashamed of it.—We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\\nmay be prevailed with to try it this evening.”\\n\\nMiss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole’s, turned\\nto Frank Churchill.\\n\\n“Why do you smile?” said she.\\n\\n“Nay, why do you?”\\n\\n“Me!—I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell’s being so rich\\nand so liberal.—It is a handsome present.”\\n\\n“Very.”\\n\\n“I rather wonder that it was never made before.”\\n\\n“Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.”\\n\\n“Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument—which must\\nnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.”\\n\\n“That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\\nBates’s house.”\\n\\n“You may _say_ what you chuse—but your countenance testifies that your\\n_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.”\\n\\n“I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\nacuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\\nsuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\\nthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\\nbe?”\\n\\n“What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?”\\n\\n“Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She\\nmust know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be;\\nand perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a\\nyoung woman’s scheme than an elderly man’s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare\\nsay. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.”\\n\\n“If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Mr. Dixon.—Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\\njoint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day,\\nyou know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.”\\n\\n“Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\\nentertained before.—I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\\nof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting\\neither that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the\\nmisfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a\\nlittle attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without\\nguessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular\\ncause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the\\nCampbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and\\npenance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of\\ntrying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.—In the summer\\nit might have passed; but what can any body’s native air do for them in\\nthe months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages\\nwould be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and\\nI dare say in her’s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,\\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell\\nyou what they are.”\\n\\n“And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon’s\\npreference of her music to her friend’s, I can answer for being very\\ndecided.”\\n\\n“And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?—A water party;\\nand by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.”\\n\\n“He did. I was there—one of the party.”\\n\\n“Were you really?—Well!—But you observed nothing of course, for it\\nseems to be a new idea to you.—If I had been there, I think I should\\nhave made some discoveries.”\\n\\n“I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\\nMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon\\ncaught her.—It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent\\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durable—indeed I believe\\nit was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again—yet that\\nwas too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\\nobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\\ndiscoveries.”\\n\\nThe conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in\\nthe awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\\nobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the\\ntable was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed\\nexactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma\\nsaid,\\n\\n“The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a\\nlittle more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\\nsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.”\\n\\n“And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\\nconclude it to come from the Campbells.”\\n\\n“No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\\nnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\\nwould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\\nconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\\nDixon is a principal in the business.”\\n\\n“Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\\nyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\\npaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\\nBut when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that\\nit should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see\\nit in no other light than as an offering of love.”\\n\\nThere was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction\\nseemed real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other\\nsubjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the\\ndessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired\\namid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few\\ndownright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor\\nthe other—nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old\\nnews, and heavy jokes.\\n\\nThe ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\\nladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\\nof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\\ndignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\\nthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\\ncheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\\nalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\\naffection. There she sat—and who would have guessed how many tears she\\nhad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\\nseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\\nnothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\\ndid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad\\nto change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\\nmortification of having loved—yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\\nvain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\\nbeloved by the husband of her friend.\\n\\nIn so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\\nShe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\\nsecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\\nand therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\\nsubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\\nconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of\\nguilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend Colonel\\nCampbell.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by\\nthe circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\\nto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\\nof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\\nfair heroine’s countenance.\\n\\nThey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of\\nthe early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\\nhandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\\nand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the\\ncircle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\\nwould not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be\\nthinking. She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She\\nintroduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\\nafterwards, heard what each thought of the other. “He had never seen so\\nlovely a face, and was delighted with her naïveté.” And she, “Only to\\nbe sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think\\nthere were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.” Emma restrained her\\nindignation, and only turned from her in silence.\\n\\nSmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\nglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\\nHe told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated\\nsitting long—was always the first to move when he could—that his\\nfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\\nparish business—that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\\npleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of\\ngentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury\\naltogether—thought it so abundant in agreeable families—that Emma began\\nto feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much. She\\nquestioned him as to the society in Yorkshire—the extent of the\\nneighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his\\nanswers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little\\ngoing on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,\\nnone very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations\\naccepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health\\nand spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\\nperson; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not\\nwithout difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he\\ncould get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.\\n\\nShe saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\\nits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement\\nat home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He\\ndid not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded\\nhis aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and\\nnoticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he\\ncould _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on\\nwhich his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much\\nto go abroad—had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she\\nwould not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he\\nsaid, he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\\n\\nThe unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\\ngood behaviour to his father.\\n\\n“I have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.—\\n“I have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. I never knew days fly\\nso fast. A week to-morrow!—And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But\\njust got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!—I hate the\\nrecollection.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\\nof so few, in having your hair cut.”\\n\\n“No,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. I have no\\npleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\\nseen.”\\n\\nThe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.\\nWhen Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as\\nbefore, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at\\nMiss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\\n\\n“What is the matter?” said she.\\n\\nHe started. “Thank you for rousing me,” he replied. “I believe I have\\nbeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\\nway—so very odd a way—that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\\nany thing so outrée!—Those curls!—This must be a fancy of her own. I\\nsee nobody else looking like her!—I must go and ask her whether it is\\nan Irish fashion. Shall I?—Yes, I will—I declare I will—and you shall\\nsee how she takes it;—whether she colours.”\\n\\nHe was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\\nFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as\\nhe had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\\nfront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\\n\\nBefore he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\\n\\n“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she:—“one can get near\\nevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to\\nyou. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\\nyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\\nMiss Bates and her niece came here?”\\n\\n“How?—They were invited, were not they?”\\n\\n“Oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their\\ncoming?”\\n\\n“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”\\n\\n“Very true.—Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it\\nwould be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\\ncold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\\nher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\\nwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\\nnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\\nand I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may\\nguess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I\\nmade my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage\\nwould be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would\\nbe making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as\\npossible, you may be sure. ‘Nobody was ever so fortunate as\\nherself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to trouble\\nus, for Mr. Knightley’s carriage had brought, and was to take them home\\nagain.’ I was quite surprized;—very glad, I am sure; but really quite\\nsurprized. Such a very kind attention—and so thoughtful an\\nattention!—the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in\\nshort, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think\\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do\\nsuspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it\\nwas only as an excuse for assisting them.”\\n\\n“Very likely,” said Emma—“nothing more likely. I know no man more\\nlikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing—to do any thing\\nreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\\ngallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\\nFairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for\\nan act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\\nmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day—for we arrived\\ntogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\\ncould betray.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more\\nsimple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while\\nMiss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have\\nnever been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more\\nprobable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr.\\nKnightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you\\ncompany!—What do you say to it?”\\n\\n“Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!” exclaimed Emma. “Dear Mrs. Weston,\\nhow could you think of such a thing?—Mr. Knightley!—Mr. Knightley must\\nnot marry!—You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?—Oh!\\nno, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr.\\nKnightley’s marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am\\namazed that you should think of such a thing.”\\n\\n“My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not\\nwant the match—I do not want to injure dear little Henry—but the idea\\nhas been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished\\nto marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry’s account, a boy of\\nsix years old, who knows nothing of the matter?”\\n\\n“Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.—Mr. Knightley\\nmarry!—No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.\\nAnd Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!”\\n\\n“Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\\nknow.”\\n\\n“But the imprudence of such a match!”\\n\\n“I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”\\n\\n“I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\\nwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\\nbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for\\nthe Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax—and is always glad\\nto shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to\\nmatch-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the\\nAbbey!—Oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not\\nhave him do so mad a thing.”\\n\\n“Imprudent, if you please—but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.”\\n\\n“But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\\nleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?—He\\nis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\\nhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\\nhis brother’s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\\nhis time or his heart.”\\n\\n“My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\\nloves Jane Fairfax—”\\n\\n“Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I\\nam sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but—”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could\\ndo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.”\\n\\n“If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\\nvery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\\nBates belonging to him?—To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\\nhim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?—‘So very kind\\nand obliging!—But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ And\\nthen fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother’s old petticoat.\\n‘Not that it was such a very old petticoat either—for still it would\\nlast a great while—and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their\\npetticoats were all very strong.’”\\n\\n“For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my\\nconscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be\\nmuch disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She\\nmight talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only\\ntalk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it\\nwould be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think\\nhe does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of\\nJane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her—his anxiety about her\\nhealth—his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have\\nheard him express himself so warmly on those points!—Such an admirer of\\nher performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him\\nsay that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost\\nforgotten one idea that occurred to me—this pianoforte that has been\\nsent here by somebody—though we have all been so well satisfied to\\nconsider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr.\\nKnightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person\\nto do it, even without being in love.”\\n\\n“Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\\nthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\\nnothing mysteriously.”\\n\\n“I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;\\noftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common\\ncourse of things, occur to him.”\\n\\n“Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\\nher so.”\\n\\n“There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very\\nstrong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly\\nsilent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.”\\n\\n“You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\\nmany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment—I\\nbelieve nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that\\nMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.”\\n\\nThey combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the\\nmost used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed\\nthem that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;—and at the\\nsame moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do\\nthem the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the\\neagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing\\nnothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr.\\nCole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it\\nsuited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance.\\n\\nShe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more\\nthan she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit\\nin the little things which are generally acceptable, and could\\naccompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her\\nagreeably by surprize—a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank\\nChurchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and\\nevery thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful\\nvoice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and\\nthat he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly\\nasserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her\\nplace to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental,\\nshe never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely\\nsuperior to her own.\\n\\nWith mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\\nnumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\\nThey had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\\nsight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\\nEmma’s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\\nMrs. Weston’s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united\\nvoices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr.\\nKnightley’s marrying did not in the least subside. She could see\\nnothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John\\nKnightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children—a\\nmost mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great\\ndeduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could\\nnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\\nKnightley for them all to give way to!—No—Mr. Knightley must never\\nmarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\\n\\nPresently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\\ntalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\\nvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\\nstruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\\nkindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\\nthe spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate\\nonly his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\\n\\n“I often feel concern,” said she, “that I dare not make our carriage\\nmore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish;\\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should\\nput-to for such a purpose.”\\n\\n“Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,” he\\nreplied;—“but you must often wish it, I am sure.” And he smiled with\\nsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\\nstep.\\n\\n“This present from the Campbells,” said she—“this pianoforte is very\\nkindly given.”\\n\\n“Yes,” he replied, and without the smallest apparent\\nembarrassment.—“But they would have done better had they given her\\nnotice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\\nenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\\nexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.”\\n\\nFrom that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\\nhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely\\nfree from peculiar attachment—whether there were no actual\\npreference—remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane’s\\nsecond song, her voice grew thick.\\n\\n“That will do,” said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud—“you have\\nsung quite enough for one evening—now be quiet.”\\n\\nAnother song, however, was soon begged for. “One more;—they would not\\nfatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.”\\nAnd Frank Churchill was heard to say, “I think you could manage this\\nwithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\\nsong falls on the second.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley grew angry.\\n\\n“That fellow,” said he, indignantly, “thinks of nothing but shewing off\\nhis own voice. This must not be.” And touching Miss Bates, who at that\\nmoment passed near—“Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\\nherself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\\nher.”\\n\\nMiss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be\\ngrateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\\nsinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss\\nWoodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but\\nsoon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing—originating nobody\\nexactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole,\\nthat every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs.\\nWeston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an\\nirresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming\\ngallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\\n\\nWhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\\nEmma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\\nvoice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\\nKnightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\\nwere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\\nsomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to\\nMrs. Cole—he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody\\nelse, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\\n\\nEmma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\\nshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\\nfive couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it\\nmade it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\\npartner. They were a couple worth looking at.\\n\\nTwo dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\\ngrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her\\nmother’s account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to\\nbegin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful,\\nand have done.\\n\\n“Perhaps it is as well,” said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\\nher carriage. “I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\\nwould not have agreed with me, after yours.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\\nafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\\nmight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\\nbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\\nthe Coles—worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!—And left a name\\nbehind her that would not soon die away.\\n\\nPerfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\\npoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\\ntransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\\nJane Fairfax’s feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\\nhad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his\\nsubmission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration,\\nwhich made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to\\nhave held her tongue.\\n\\nThe other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\\nthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret\\nthe inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\\ngrieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and practised\\nvigorously an hour and a half.\\n\\nShe was then interrupted by Harriet’s coming in; and if Harriet’s\\npraise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\\n\\n“Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!”\\n\\n“Don’t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her’s,\\nthan a lamp is like sunshine.”\\n\\n“Oh! dear—I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\\nas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\\nlast night said how well you played.”\\n\\n“Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\\ntruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\\nbut Jane Fairfax’s is much beyond it.”\\n\\n“Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\\nthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\\nsaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great\\ndeal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than\\nexecution.”\\n\\n“Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.”\\n\\n“Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\\ntaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.—There is no\\nunderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\\nknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\\nteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\\nany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?”\\n\\n“Just as they always do—very vulgar.”\\n\\n“They told me something,” said Harriet rather hesitatingly; “but it is\\nnothing of any consequence.”\\n\\nEmma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\\nproducing Mr. Elton.\\n\\n“They told me—that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.”\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\n“He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay\\nto dinner.”\\n\\n“Oh!”\\n\\n“They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\\nwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay\\nthere again next summer.”\\n\\n“She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\\nbe.”\\n\\n“She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her\\nat dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to\\nmarry him.”\\n\\n“Very likely.—I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\\ngirls in Highbury.”\\n\\nHarriet had business at Ford’s.—Emma thought it most prudent to go with\\nher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\\nher present state, would be dangerous.\\n\\nHarriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\\nvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\\nand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.—Much could\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr.\\nPerry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\\noffice-door, Mr. Cole’s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\\nstray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\\ncould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher\\nwith his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her\\nfull basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of\\ndawdling children round the baker’s little bow-window eyeing the\\ngingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused\\nenough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at\\nease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not\\nanswer.\\n\\nShe looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\\nappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\\nHighbury;—to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\\nfirst place at Mrs. Bates’s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls\\nthan Ford’s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\\neye.—Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\\nagreeableness of yesterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure\\nto the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to\\ncall on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\\n\\n“For my companion tells me,” said she, “that I absolutely promised Miss\\nBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\\nmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\\nam going now.”\\n\\n“And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,” said\\nFrank Churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield—if\\nyou are going home.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disappointed.\\n\\n“I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.”\\n\\n“Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps—I may be equally in the\\nway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt\\nalways sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to\\ndeath; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same.\\nWhat am I to do?”\\n\\n“I am here on no business of my own,” said Emma; “I am only waiting for\\nmy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\\nBut you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.”\\n\\n“Well—if you advise it.—But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\\nhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\\nindifferent tone—what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\\nWeston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would\\nbe palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the\\nworld at a civil falsehood.”\\n\\n“I do not believe any such thing,” replied Emma.—“I am persuaded that\\nyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\\nthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\\notherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax’s opinion last night.”\\n\\n“Do come with me,” said Mrs. Weston, “if it be not very disagreeable to\\nyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We\\nwill follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\\nwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.”\\n\\nHe could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\\nreturned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates’s door. Emma watched them in,\\nand then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all\\nthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\\nit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\\nlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\\n\\n“Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard’s, ma’am?” asked Mrs.\\nFord.—“Yes—no—yes, to Mrs. Goddard’s. Only my pattern gown is at\\nHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\\nMrs. Goddard will want to see it.—And I could take the pattern gown\\nhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly—so it had better go\\nto Hartfield—at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\\nMrs. Ford, could not you?”\\n\\n“It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\\nparcels.”\\n\\n“No more it is.”\\n\\n“No trouble in the world, ma’am,” said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\\n\\n“Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\\nplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard’s—I do not know—No, I\\nthink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield,\\nand take it home with me at night. What do you advise?”\\n\\n“That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\\nif you please, Mrs. Ford.”\\n\\n“Aye, that will be much best,” said Harriet, quite satisfied, “I should\\nnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard’s.”\\n\\nVoices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\\nWeston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\\n\\n“My dear Miss Woodhouse,” said the latter, “I am just run across to\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\\ndo you do, Miss Smith?—Very well I thank you.—And I begged Mrs. Weston\\nto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.”\\n\\n“I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are—”\\n\\n“Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\\nand Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?—I am so glad\\nto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.—Oh!\\nthen, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\\njust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\\nvery happy to see her—and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\\nrefuse.—‘Aye, pray do,’ said Mr. Frank Churchill, ‘Miss Woodhouse’s\\nopinion of the instrument will be worth having.’—But, said I, I shall\\nbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.—‘Oh,’ said\\nhe, ‘wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;’—For, would you\\nbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\\nthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother’s spectacles.—The rivet\\ncame out, you know, this morning.—So very obliging!—For my mother had\\nno use of her spectacles—could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\\nbody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane\\nsaid so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I\\ndid, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one\\nthing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time\\nPatty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh,\\nsaid I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet\\nof your mistress’s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home,\\nMrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging\\nto us, the Wallises, always—I have heard some people say that Mrs.\\nWallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never\\nknown any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be\\nfor the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread,\\nyou know? Only three of us.—besides dear Jane at present—and she really\\neats nothing—makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite\\nfrightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she\\neats—so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But\\nabout the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she\\nlikes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,\\nfor I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I\\nhappened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before—I\\nhave so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it\\nis the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly\\nwholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an\\nexcellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I\\nhope, and these ladies will oblige us.”\\n\\nEmma would be “very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,” and they did at\\nlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\\n\\n“How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\\nI hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\\ncame back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a\\nlittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.”\\n\\n“What was I talking of?” said she, beginning again when they were all\\nin the street.\\n\\nEmma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\\n\\n“I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.—Oh! my mother’s\\nspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘I\\ndo think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\\nexcessively.’—Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\\nsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\\nhe very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\\nmost warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘Oh!’\\nsaid he, ‘I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\\nexcessively.’ I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\\nthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so\\nvery obliging as to take some, ‘Oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is\\nnothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the\\nfinest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.’ That, you\\nknow, was so very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no\\ncompliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis\\ndoes them full justice—only we do not have them baked more than twice,\\nand Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times—but\\nMiss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples\\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\\nfrom Donwell—some of Mr. Knightley’s most liberal supply. He sends us a\\nsack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\\nanywhere as one of his trees—I believe there is two of them. My mother\\nsays the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was\\nreally quite shocked the other day—for Mr. Knightley called one\\nmorning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and\\nsaid how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to\\nthe end of our stock. ‘I am sure you must be,’ said he, ‘and I will\\nsend you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever\\nuse. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this\\nyear. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.’ So\\nI begged he would not—for really as to ours being gone, I could not\\nabsolutely say that we had a great many left—it was but half a dozen\\nindeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all\\nbear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been\\nalready; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost\\nquarrelled with me—No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a\\nquarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\\napples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a\\ngreat many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.\\nHowever, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large\\nbasket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was\\nvery much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said\\nevery thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old\\nacquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found\\nafterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of\\n_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all—and now his master\\nhad not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it\\nhimself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for\\nWilliam, you know, thinks more of his master’s profit than any thing;\\nbut Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent\\naway. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have\\nanother apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not\\nmind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.\\nHodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were\\nsold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me,\\nand I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\\nknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\\nto keep it from Jane’s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\\nbefore I was aware.”\\n\\nMiss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\\n\\n“Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\\ncare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and\\nnarrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\\nWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\\nSmith, the step at the turning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\\ntranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\\nslumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\\nher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\\nstanding with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\\n\\nBusy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most\\nhappy countenance on seeing Emma again.\\n\\n“This is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least\\nten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\\nuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.”\\n\\n“What!” said Mrs. Weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not\\nearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”\\n\\n“I have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “I have been\\nassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\\nit was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\\nwe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to\\nbe persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”\\n\\nHe contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to\\nmake her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite\\nready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately\\nready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had\\nnot yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without\\nemotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and\\nEmma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could\\nnot but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.\\n\\nAt last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\\npowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\\nWeston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined\\nher in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\\ndiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\\n\\n“Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,” said Frank Churchill, with a\\nsmile at Emma, “the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\\nColonel Campbell’s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\\nnotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\\nparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\\nfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not\\nyou think so?”\\n\\nJane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\\nbeen speaking to her at the same moment.\\n\\n“It is not fair,” said Emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. Do\\nnot distress her.”\\n\\nHe shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\\ndoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\\n\\n“How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on\\nthis occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and\\nwonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s\\ncoming to hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to\\nbe going forward just at this time?—Do you imagine it to be the\\nconsequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have\\nsent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to\\ndepend upon contingencies and conveniences?”\\n\\nHe paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\\n\\n“Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,” said she, in a voice of\\nforced calmness, “I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\\nall conjecture.”\\n\\n“Conjecture—aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\\nconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\\nrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at\\nwork, if one talks at all;—your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\\ntongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word—Miss\\nFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have\\nthe pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles,\\nhealed for the present.”\\n\\nHe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\\nlittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\\nFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\\n\\n“If you are very kind,” said he, “it will be one of the waltzes we\\ndanced last night;—let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\\nas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\\ndanced no longer; but I would have given worlds—all the worlds one ever\\nhas to give—for another half-hour.”\\n\\nShe played.\\n\\n“What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\\nhappy!—If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.”\\n\\nShe looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played\\nsomething else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,\\nand turning to Emma, said,\\n\\n“Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?—Cramer.—And here\\nare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\\nexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\\nColonel Campbell, was not it?—He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\\nhere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\\nhave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\\nincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.”\\n\\nEmma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\\nand when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the\\nremains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of\\nconsciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less\\nscruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to\\nher.—This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently\\ncherishing very reprehensible feelings.\\n\\nHe brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.—Emma\\ntook the opportunity of whispering,\\n\\n“You speak too plain. She must understand you.”\\n\\n“I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\\nashamed of my meaning.”\\n\\n“But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the\\nidea.”\\n\\n“I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\\na key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\\nwrong, she ought to feel it.”\\n\\n“She is not entirely without it, I think.”\\n\\n“I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\\nmoment—_his_ favourite.”\\n\\nShortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\\nKnightley on horse-back not far off.\\n\\n“Mr. Knightley I declare!—I must speak to him if possible, just to\\nthank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\\nbut I can go into my mother’s room you know. I dare say he will come in\\nwhen he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\\nso!—Our little room so honoured!”\\n\\nShe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\\ncasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley’s attention, and every\\nsyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others,\\nas if it had passed within the same apartment.\\n\\n“How d’ ye do?—how d’ye do?—Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\\nfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\\nfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.”\\n\\nSo began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\\nhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\\n\\n“How is your niece, Miss Bates?—I want to inquire after you all, but\\nparticularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?—I hope she caught no cold\\nlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.”\\n\\nAnd Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\\nher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\\nEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\\nsteady scepticism.\\n\\n“So obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage,”\\nresumed Miss Bates.\\n\\nHe cut her short with,\\n\\n“I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?”\\n\\n“Oh! dear, Kingston—are you?—Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\\nwanted something from Kingston.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?”\\n\\n“No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?—Miss\\nWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new\\npianoforte. Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.”\\n\\n“Well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”\\n\\n“And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!—Quite delightful;\\nso many friends!”\\n\\n“No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\\nto Kingston as fast as I can.”\\n\\n“Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.”\\n\\n“No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear\\nthe pianoforte.”\\n\\n“Well, I am so sorry!—Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\\nnight; how extremely pleasant.—Did you ever see such dancing?—Was not\\nit delightful?—Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\\nthing equal to it.”\\n\\n“Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\\nWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\\nAnd (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\\nnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\\nWeston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in\\nEngland. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\\nsomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\\nhear it.”\\n\\n“Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so\\nshocked!—Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!”\\n\\n“What is the matter now?”\\n\\n“To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a\\ngreat many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\\nMrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\\nshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\\ncan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\\nwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to\\nthe room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop.\\nHe is going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Jane, “we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\\nopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\\nhave heard every thing to be sure. ‘Can I do any thing for you at\\nKingston?’ said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must\\nyou be going?—You seem but just come—so very obliging of you.”\\n\\nEmma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\\nlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to\\nbe gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\\nallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\\ngates, before they set off for Randalls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\\nknown of young people passing many, many months successively, without\\nbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\\neither to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the\\nfelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt—it\\nmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\\n\\nFrank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\\nand the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\\nto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\\npeople in schemes on the subject. Frank’s was the first idea; and his\\nthe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of\\nthe difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and\\nappearance. But still she had inclination enough for shewing people\\nagain how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse\\ndanced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself\\nwith Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any of\\nthe wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room\\nthey were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking\\nthe dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in\\nspite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,\\nthat it was a little the largest.\\n\\nHis first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole’s\\nshould be finished there—that the same party should be collected, and\\nthe same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\\nWeston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\\nmost willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\\nand the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly\\nwho there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of\\nspace to every couple.\\n\\n“You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\\nCoxes five,” had been repeated many times over. “And there will be the\\ntwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\\nYes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\\nMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\\ncouple there will be plenty of room.”\\n\\nBut soon it came to be on one side,\\n\\n“But will there be good room for five couple?—I really do not think\\nthere will.”\\n\\nOn another,\\n\\n“And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\\nstand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\\nIt will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\\nthought of the moment.”\\n\\nSomebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother’s, and\\nmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\\nwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\\nput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one\\nfamily of cousins who must be included, and another of very old\\nacquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the\\nfive couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation\\nin what possible manner they could be disposed of.\\n\\nThe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “Might not\\nthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” It seemed the best\\nscheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\\nbetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress\\nabout the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score\\nof health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\\npersevered in.\\n\\n“Oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\\nbear it for Emma!—Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\\nSo would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\\nbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\\nnot let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\\nthoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\\nthe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and\\nkeeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\\ndraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\\nquite the thing!”\\n\\nMrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it,\\nand said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\\nclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\\nin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\\nFrank Churchill’s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour\\nbefore had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now\\nendeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.\\n\\n“We were too magnificent,” said he. “We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\\ncouple may stand here very well.”\\n\\nEmma demurred. “It would be a crowd—a sad crowd; and what could be\\nworse than dancing without space to turn in?”\\n\\n“Very true,” he gravely replied; “it was very bad.” But still he went\\non measuring, and still he ended with,\\n\\n“I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.”\\n\\n“No, no,” said she, “you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\\nto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to\\nbe dancing in a crowd—and a crowd in a little room!”\\n\\n“There is no denying it,” he replied. “I agree with you exactly. A\\ncrowd in a little room—Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\\npictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!—Still, however,\\nhaving proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It\\nwould be a disappointment to my father—and altogether—I do not know\\nthat—I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very\\nwell.”\\n\\nEmma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\nself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\\ndancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\\nHad she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\\npause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\\nand the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\\nacquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\\nthe scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\\n\\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” he almost immediately began, “your inclination\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\\nof my father’s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:—a\\nthought of my father’s, which waits only your approbation to be acted\\nupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\\nof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\\nCrown Inn?”\\n\\n“The Crown!”\\n\\n“Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you\\ncannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him\\nthere. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less\\ngrateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees\\nno objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all\\nfeel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the\\nRandalls rooms, would have been insufferable!—Dreadful!—I felt how\\nright you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_\\n_thing_ to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?—You consent—I hope\\nyou consent?”\\n\\n“It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\\nmyself, shall be most happy—It seems the only improvement that could\\nbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?”\\n\\nShe was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\\ncomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\\nnecessary to make it acceptable.\\n\\n“No; he thought it very far from an improvement—a very bad plan—much\\nworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\\nnever properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\\nhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the\\nCrown in his life—did not know the people who kept it by sight.—Oh!\\nno—a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than\\nanywhere.”\\n\\n“I was going to observe, sir,” said Frank Churchill, “that one of the\\ngreat recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of\\nany body’s catching cold—so much less danger at the Crown than at\\nRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\\nnobody else could.”\\n\\n“Sir,” said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, “you are very much mistaken\\nif you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\\nextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\\nthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father’s house.”\\n\\n“From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\\noccasion to open the windows at all—not once the whole evening; and it\\nis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\\nheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.”\\n\\n“Open the windows!—but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\\nopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\\nheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!—I am sure, neither\\nyour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\\nit.”\\n\\n“Ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\\nwindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I\\nhave often known it done myself.”\\n\\n“Have you indeed, sir?—Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\\nlive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\\nthis does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\\nover—but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\\ncannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\\nobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\\ncan be done.”\\n\\n“But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited—”\\n\\n“Oh!” interrupted Emma, “there will be plenty of time for talking every\\nthing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\\nthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will\\nbe so near their own stable.”\\n\\n“So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\\ncomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\\nbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired—but is Mrs. Stokes to be\\ntrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.”\\n\\n“I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\\nunder Mrs. Weston’s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.”\\n\\n“There, papa!—Now you must be satisfied—Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\\nis carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\\nyears ago, when I had the measles? ‘If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\\nwrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ How often have I\\nheard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”\\n\\n“Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\\nlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would\\nhave been very bad, but for Perry’s great attention. He came four times\\na day for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good\\nsort—which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful\\ncomplaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella’s little ones have the\\nmeasles, she will send for Perry.”\\n\\n“My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,” said Frank\\nChurchill, “examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\\nand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\\nmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\\ndesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them,\\nif you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\\nsatisfactorily without you.”\\n\\nEmma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\\nset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\\nWeston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\\nvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and\\nhe, finding every thing perfect.\\n\\n“Emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\\nyou see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\\nforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.”\\n\\n“My dear, you are too particular,” said her husband. “What does all\\nthat signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\\nclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\\nclub-nights.”\\n\\nThe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, “Men never know\\nwhen things are dirty or not;” and the gentlemen perhaps thought each\\nto himself, “Women will have their little nonsenses and needless\\ncares.”\\n\\nOne perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It\\nregarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom’s being built,\\nsuppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\\nthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\\nas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by\\ntheir four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\\nsupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\\npurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\\npassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\\nWeston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and\\nneither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\\nmiserably crowded at supper.\\n\\nMrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c.,\\nset out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\\nsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\\npronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.\\nWeston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\\nexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\\n\\n“I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.”\\n\\nAnd Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\\nthrough the passage, was calling out,\\n\\n“You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\\nmere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”\\n\\n“I wish,” said Mrs. Weston, “one could know which arrangement our\\nguests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally\\npleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.”\\n\\n“Yes, very true,” cried Frank, “very true. You want your neighbours’\\nopinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\\nof them—the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\\nupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.—And I do not know\\nwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\\nthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger\\ncouncil. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?”\\n\\n“Well—if you please,” said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, “if you think\\nshe will be of any use.”\\n\\n“You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,” said Emma. “She\\nwill be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\\nwill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in\\nconsulting Miss Bates.”\\n\\n“But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\\nMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.”\\n\\nHere Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\\nhis decided approbation.\\n\\n“Aye, do, Frank.—Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\\nonce. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a\\nproperer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss\\nBates. We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of\\nhow to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.”\\n\\n“Both sir! Can the old lady?”...\\n\\n“The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a\\ngreat blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”\\n\\n“Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\\nUndoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.”\\nAnd away he ran.\\n\\nLong before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving\\naunt, and her elegant niece,—Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman\\nand a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of\\nit much less than she had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and\\nhere ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation\\nat least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\\nchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\\nas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\\nStokes.—Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\\nwritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\\nwhich could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\\nbe.\\n\\nMost cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must. As\\na counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\\ncharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general and\\nminute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\\nhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different\\nrooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of\\nthe future. The party did not break up without Emma’s being positively\\nsecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor\\nwithout her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, “He has asked\\nher, my dear. That’s right. I knew he would!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\\nsatisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term\\nof Frank Churchill’s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston’s\\nconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\\nChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\\nfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\\ntheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\\nentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\\nhoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion, the great risk, of\\nits being all in vain.\\n\\nEnscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\\nwish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not\\nopposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one\\nsolicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of\\nher ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley’s provoking\\nindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\\nbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed\\nresolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\\nexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\\nTo her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\\nthan,\\n\\n“Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\\nagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—Oh! yes, I\\nmust be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I\\ncan; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins’s\\nweek’s account; much rather, I confess.—Pleasure in seeing dancing!—not\\nI, indeed—I never look at it—I do not know who does.—Fine dancing, I\\nbelieve, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by\\nare usually thinking of something very different.”\\n\\nThis Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was\\nnot in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent,\\nor so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the\\nball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.\\nIt made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—\\n\\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\\nWhat a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\\n_very_ great pleasure.”\\n\\nIt was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have\\npreferred the society of William Larkins. No!—she was more and more\\nconvinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There\\nwas a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his\\nside—but no love.\\n\\nAlas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\\ndays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\\nevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew’s\\ninstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without\\nhim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when\\nwriting to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\\nunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\\nherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\\nand must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\\n\\nThe substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\\nWeston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\\nwithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\\nto lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred\\nbut for her own convenience.\\n\\nMrs. Weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\\nHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom\\nhe could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\\nexpected at Hartfield very soon.”\\n\\nThis wretched note was the finale of Emma’s breakfast. When once it had\\nbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\\nloss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man\\nmight be feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it\\nwould have been!—Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\\nhappiest!—“I said it would be so,” was the only consolation.\\n\\nHer father’s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\\nMrs. Churchill’s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and\\nas for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but\\nthey would all be safer at home.\\n\\nEmma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if\\nthis reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total\\nwant of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going\\naway almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\\nsat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\\nhimself, it was only to say,\\n\\n“Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.”\\n\\n“But you will come again,” said Emma. “This will not be your only visit\\nto Randalls.”\\n\\n“Ah!—(shaking his head)—the uncertainty of when I may be able to\\nreturn!—I shall try for it with a zeal!—It will be the object of all my\\nthoughts and cares!—and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring—but\\nI am afraid—they did not stir last spring—I am afraid it is a custom\\ngone for ever.”\\n\\n“Our poor ball must be quite given up.”\\n\\n“Ah! that ball!—why did we wait for any thing?—why not seize the\\npleasure at once?—How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\\nfoolish preparation!—You told us it would be so.—Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\\nwhy are you always so right?”\\n\\n“Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\\nrather have been merry than wise.”\\n\\n“If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\\non it. Do not forget your engagement.”\\n\\nEmma looked graciously.\\n\\n“Such a fortnight as it has been!” he continued; “every day more\\nprecious and more delightful than the day before!—every day making me\\nless fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\\nHighbury!”\\n\\n“As you do us such ample justice now,” said Emma, laughing, “I will\\nventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\\nDo not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\\nyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\\ncoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.”\\n\\nHe laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\\nwas convinced that it had been so.\\n\\n“And you must be off this very morning?”\\n\\n“Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\\nmust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will\\nbring him.”\\n\\n“Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\\nBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates’s powerful, argumentative mind might\\nhave strengthened yours.”\\n\\n“Yes—I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\\nwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\\nby Miss Bates’s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\\nto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\\nlaugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay\\nmy visit, then”—\\n\\nHe hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\\n\\n“In short,” said he, “perhaps, Miss Woodhouse—I think you can hardly be\\nquite without suspicion”—\\n\\nHe looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\\nwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\\nserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore,\\nin the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\\n\\n“You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\\nthen”—\\n\\nHe was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\\non what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\\nhim sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\\nHe could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\\npassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\\n\\n“It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given\\nto Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm”—\\n\\nHe stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—He was more\\nin love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\\nhave ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\\nsoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\\n\\nA very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\\nWeston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\\nprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\\nwas doubtful, said, “It was time to go;” and the young man, though he\\nmight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\\n\\n“I shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. I\\nshall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\\nMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\\nit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\\ninterested in the absent!—she will tell me every thing. In her letters\\nI shall be at dear Highbury again.”\\n\\nA very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest “Good-bye,” closed\\nthe speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had\\nbeen the notice—short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so\\nsorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from\\nhis absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it\\ntoo much.\\n\\nIt was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\\narrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the\\nlast two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of\\nseeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\\nattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\\nfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\\ncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he\\nhad _almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what\\nconstancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but\\nat present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,\\na conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all\\nthe rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him,\\nin spite of every previous determination against it.\\n\\n“I certainly must,” said she. “This sensation of listlessness,\\nweariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ\\nmyself, this feeling of every thing’s being dull and insipid about the\\nhouse!— I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world\\nif I were not—for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always\\ngood to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not\\nfor Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the\\nevening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not\\nsay that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would\\nhave contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that\\nhe was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with\\nconsiderable kindness added,\\n\\n“You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really\\nout of luck; you are very much out of luck!”\\n\\nIt was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\\nregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was\\nodious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\\nheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\\ntaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\\ncharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\\nill-health.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\\nonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\\ndeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\\nFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than\\never in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,\\nand quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how\\nwere his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his\\ncoming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could\\nnot admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be\\nless disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and\\ncheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have\\nfaults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat\\ndrawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress\\nand close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and\\ninventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary\\ndeclaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection\\nwas always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming\\nwas to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became\\nsensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in\\nlove; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to\\nquit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must\\nproduce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.\\n\\n“I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,” said\\nshe.—“In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\\nthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\\nreally necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\\nnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love.\\nI should be sorry to be more.”\\n\\nUpon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his\\nfeelings.\\n\\n“_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love—every thing denotes it—very much\\nin love indeed!—and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I\\nmust be on my guard not to encourage it.—It would be most inexcusable\\nto do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I imagine he\\ncan think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had believed\\nme at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched.\\nCould he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at\\nparting would have been different.—Still, however, I must be on my\\nguard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it\\nnow is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him\\nto be quite the sort of man—I do not altogether build upon his\\nsteadiness or constancy.—His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them\\nrather changeable.—Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes\\nme thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.—I shall do\\nvery well again after a little while—and then, it will be a good thing\\nover; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I\\nshall have been let off easily.”\\n\\nWhen his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\\nshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at\\nfirst shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\\nundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\\nthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\\naffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and\\ndescribing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\\nattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\\napology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\\nWeston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\\nbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\\njust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much\\nmore might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.—The\\ncharm of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more\\nthan once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either\\na compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and\\nin the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by\\nany such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\\nher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\\nconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\\nwords—“I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\\nWoodhouse’s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to\\nher.” This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\\nremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\\nas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\\nMrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\\nimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\\n\\nGratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\\npart, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\\nto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she\\ncould still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without\\nher. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew\\nmore interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent\\nconsolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words\\nwhich clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the\\nidea of Harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. Was it\\nimpossible?—No.—Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\\nunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of\\nher face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\\nprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.—For\\nHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\\n\\n“I must not dwell upon it,” said she.—“I must not think of it. I know\\nthe danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\\nhappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\\nwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\\nfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.”\\n\\nIt was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet’s behalf, though it\\nmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that\\nquarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill’s arrival had succeeded Mr.\\nElton’s engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest\\ninterest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank\\nChurchill’s disappearance, Mr. Elton’s concerns were assuming the most\\nirresistible form.—His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among\\nthem again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over\\nthe first letter from Enscombe before “Mr. Elton and his bride” was in\\nevery body’s mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick\\nat the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr.\\nElton; and Harriet’s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been\\nlately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston’s ball in view at least, there\\nhad been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now\\ntoo evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as\\ncould stand against the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing, and\\nall.\\n\\nPoor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\\ngive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet\\nhad a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy\\nwork to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever\\nagreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet\\nlistened submissively, and said “it was very true—it was just as Miss\\nWoodhouse described—it was not worth while to think about them—and she\\nwould not think about them any longer” but no change of subject could\\navail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the\\nEltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\\n\\n“Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\\nElton’s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\\nYou could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It\\nwas all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\\nyou.—Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you—and it will be a\\npainful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\\nforgetting it.”\\n\\nHarriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\\nexclamation. Emma continued,\\n\\n“I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\\nless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\\nwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than\\nmy comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is\\nyour duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the\\nsuspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your\\ntranquillity. These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.\\nThey are very important—and sorry I am that you cannot feel them\\nsufficiently to act upon them. My being saved from pain is a very\\nsecondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain.\\nPerhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what\\nwas due—or rather what would be kind by me.”\\n\\nThis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\\nwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\\nloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\\nof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt\\nto what was right and support her in it very tolerably.\\n\\n“You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life—Want\\ngratitude to you!—Nobody is equal to you!—I care for nobody as I do for\\nyou!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!”\\n\\nSuch expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\\nmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\\nwell, nor valued her affection so highly before.\\n\\n“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards\\nto herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and\\ntenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all\\nthe clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.\\nIt is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\\nbeloved—which gives Isabella all her popularity.—I have it not—but I\\nknow how to prize and respect it.—Harriet is my superior in all the\\ncharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!—I would not change\\nyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\\nbreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!—Harriet is worth a\\nhundred such—And for a wife—a sensible man’s wife—it is invaluable. I\\nmention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\\ninterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\\nit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\\nsettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\\nnot pretty at all.\\n\\nEmma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to\\nmake her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she\\nmade a point of Harriet’s going with her, that the worst of the\\nbusiness might be gone through as soon as possible.\\n\\nShe could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\\nwhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\\nlace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\\nwould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\\nnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too;\\nbut she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The\\nvisit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and\\noccupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself\\nentirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one,\\nbeyond the nothing-meaning terms of being “elegantly dressed, and very\\npleasing.”\\n\\nShe did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\\nbut she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease, but not elegance.—\\nShe was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\\nwas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\\nbut neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\\nthought at least it would turn out so.\\n\\nAs for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear—but no, she would not\\npermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was\\nan awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a\\nman had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\\nwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\\nprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\\ndepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\\nElton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\\nmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\\nbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\\nlittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\\ncould be.\\n\\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse,” said Harriet, when they had quitted the house,\\nand after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; “Well, Miss\\nWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?—Is not she\\nvery charming?”\\n\\nThere was a little hesitation in Emma’s answer.\\n\\n“Oh! yes—very—a very pleasing young woman.”\\n\\n“I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.”\\n\\n“Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.”\\n\\n“I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.”\\n\\n“Oh! no—there is nothing to surprize one at all.—A pretty fortune; and\\nshe came in his way.”\\n\\n“I dare say,” returned Harriet, sighing again, “I dare say she was very\\nmuch attached to him.”\\n\\n“Perhaps she might; but it is not every man’s fate to marry the woman\\nwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought\\nthis the best offer she was likely to have.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harriet earnestly, “and well she might, nobody could ever\\nhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\\nWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\\nsuperior as ever;—but being married, you know, it is quite a different\\nthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit\\nand admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not\\nthrown himself away, is such a comfort!—She does seem a charming young\\nwoman, just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her ‘Augusta.’\\nHow delightful!”\\n\\nWhen the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\\nmore and judge better. From Harriet’s happening not to be at Hartfield,\\nand her father’s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\\nof an hour of the lady’s conversation to herself, and could composedly\\nattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs.\\nElton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\\nthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be\\nvery superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school,\\npert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of\\npeople, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant,\\nand that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\\n\\nHarriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\\nshe would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\\nmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\\nher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\\nalliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\\n\\nThe very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, “My brother\\nMr. Suckling’s seat;”—a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\\ngrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\\nmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by\\nthe size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\\nimagine. “Very like Maple Grove indeed!—She was quite struck by the\\nlikeness!—That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at\\nMaple Grove; her sister’s favourite room.”—Mr. Elton was appealed\\nto.—“Was not it astonishingly like?—She could really almost fancy\\nherself at Maple Grove.”\\n\\n“And the staircase—You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\\nstaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\\ncould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\\ndelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial\\nto as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a\\nlittle sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body\\nwho sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a\\nhome. Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\\nunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\\nwhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils\\nof matrimony.”\\n\\nEmma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\\nfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\\n\\n“So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house—the\\ngrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\\nThe laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\\nvery much in the same way—just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of\\na fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\\nmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\\nwho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\\nin the same style.”\\n\\nEmma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\\npeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\\nextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to\\nattack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\\n\\n“When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\\nyou have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\\nknow. Surry is the garden of England.”\\n\\n“Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\\ncounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\\nSurry.”\\n\\n“No, I fancy not,” replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. “I\\nnever heard any county but Surry called so.”\\n\\nEmma was silenced.\\n\\n“My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or\\nsummer at farthest,” continued Mrs. Elton; “and that will be our time\\nfor exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I\\ndare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds\\nfour perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_\\ncarriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely\\nwell. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season\\nof the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly\\nrecommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much\\npreferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you\\nknow, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as\\npossible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored\\nto King’s-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,\\njust after their first having the barouche-landau. You have many\\nparties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?”\\n\\n“No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and\\nwe are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at\\nhome than engage in schemes of pleasure.”\\n\\n“Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\\nbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at\\nMaple Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to\\nBristol, ‘I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I\\nabsolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the\\nbarouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her\\nown good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.’ Many a time\\nhas she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I\\nthink, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from\\nsociety, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to\\nmix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too\\nmuch or too little. I perfectly understand your situation, however,\\nMiss Woodhouse—(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father’s state of\\nhealth must be a great drawback. Why does not he try Bath?—Indeed he\\nshould. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of\\nits doing Mr. Woodhouse good.”\\n\\n“My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\\nbenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\\ndoes not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.”\\n\\n“Ah! that’s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\\nwaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\\nlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\\nthat it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse’s spirits,\\nwhich, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\\nrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\\non them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\\nunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\\nso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\\nsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\\nacquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\\nalways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\\nattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\\nwith.”\\n\\nIt was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea of\\nher being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\\n_introduction_—of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\\nof Mrs. Elton’s—probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help\\nof a boarder, just made a shift to live!—The dignity of Miss Woodhouse,\\nof Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\\n\\nShe restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\\nhave given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; “but their going to\\nBath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced\\nthat the place might suit her better than her father.” And then, to\\nprevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\\n\\n“I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these\\noccasions, a lady’s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has\\nlong known that you are a superior performer.”\\n\\n“Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\\nperformer!—very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a\\nquarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\\nmusic—passionately fond;—and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of\\ntaste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\\n_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\\ndelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\\ncomfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\\ninto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life\\nto me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\\nMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\\nhonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home,\\nand expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\\ndisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too—knowing what I had\\nbeen accustomed to—of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\\nWhen he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\\n_world_ I could give up—parties, balls, plays—for I had no fear of\\nretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\\nnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who\\nhad no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me\\nquite independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used\\nto, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal\\nto any sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed\\nto every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages\\nwere not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments.\\n‘But,’ said I, ‘to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without\\nsomething of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but\\nwithout music, life would be a blank to me.’”\\n\\n“We cannot suppose,” said Emma, smiling, “that Mr. Elton would hesitate\\nto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\\nI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\\npardoned, in consideration of the motive.”\\n\\n“No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\\nfind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\\nconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\\nmusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\\nWill not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\\nnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\\nparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\\npractice; for married women, you know—there is a sad story against\\nthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.”\\n\\n“But you, who are so extremely fond of it—there can be no danger,\\nsurely?”\\n\\n“I should hope not; but really when I look around among my\\nacquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music—never\\ntouches the instrument—though she played sweetly. And the same may be\\nsaid of Mrs. Jeffereys—Clara Partridge, that was—and of the two\\nMilmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can\\nenumerate. Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to\\nbe quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a\\nmarried woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was\\nhalf an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.”\\n\\n“But every thing of that kind,” said Emma, “will soon be in so regular\\na train—”\\n\\n“Well,” said Mrs. Elton, laughing, “we shall see.”\\n\\nEmma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\\nmore to say; and, after a moment’s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\\nsubject.\\n\\n“We have been calling at Randalls,” said she, “and found them both at\\nhome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\\nMr. Weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite\\nwith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good—there is\\nsomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\\ndirectly. She was your governess, I think?”\\n\\nEmma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\\nwaited for the affirmative before she went on.\\n\\n“Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\\nlady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Weston’s manners,” said Emma, “were always particularly good.\\nTheir propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\\nmodel for any young woman.”\\n\\n“And who do you think came in while we were there?”\\n\\nEmma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance—and\\nhow could she possibly guess?\\n\\n“Knightley!” continued Mrs. Elton; “Knightley himself!—Was not it\\nlucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\\nseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.’s,\\nI had a great curiosity. ‘My friend Knightley’ had been so often\\nmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\\ncaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his\\nfriend. Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much.\\nDecidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.”\\n\\nHappily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\\nbreathe.\\n\\n“Insufferable woman!” was her immediate exclamation. “Worse than I had\\nsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!—I could not have believed\\nit. Knightley!—never seen him in her life before, and call him\\nKnightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\\nvulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\\nresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\\nActually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\\nhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\\nnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\\nform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\\nWeston!—Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\\ngentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\\nmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\\nChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\\nwould be! Ah! there I am—thinking of him directly. Always the first\\nperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\\nas regularly into my mind!”—\\n\\nAll this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her\\nfather had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons’ departure,\\nand was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” he deliberately began, “considering we never saw her\\nbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\\nwas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\\nquickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe I\\nam nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\\npoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\\nyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\\nhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\\nhaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion;\\nI said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought\\nto have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it\\nshews what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into\\nVicarage Lane.”\\n\\n“I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.”\\n\\n“Yes: but a young lady—a bride—I ought to have paid my respects to her\\nif possible. It was being very deficient.”\\n\\n“But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\\nshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\\nbe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\\nmake so much of them.”\\n\\n“No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\\nwish to pay every proper attention to a lady—and a bride, especially,\\nis never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\\nknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\\nthey may.”\\n\\n“Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\\nis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\\nsuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.”\\n\\n“My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common\\npoliteness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\\nencouragement to people to marry.”\\n\\nEmma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\\n_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton’s offences, and long, very long,\\ndid they occupy her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\\nopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\\nMrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\\nwhenever they met again,—self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\\nand ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but\\nso little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\\nknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\\nand conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\\nElton’s consequence only could surpass.\\n\\nThere was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\\nfrom his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had\\nthe air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to\\nHighbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part\\nof her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of\\njudging, following the lead of Miss Bates’s good-will, or taking it for\\ngranted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she\\nprofessed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton’s\\npraise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by\\nMiss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked\\nwith a good grace of her being “very pleasant and very elegantly\\ndressed.”\\n\\nIn one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\\nfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.—Offended, probably, by the\\nlittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\\nback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\\nthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\\nnecessarily increasing Emma’s dislike. Her manners, too—and Mr.\\nElton’s, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\\nnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet’s cure; but the\\nsensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\\nmuch.—It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet’s attachment had been\\nan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,\\nunder a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to\\nhim, had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the\\nobject of their joint dislike.—When they had nothing else to say, it\\nmust be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity\\nwhich they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader\\nvent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.\\n\\nMrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\\nmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\\nrecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\\nwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration—but without\\nsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\\nbefriend her.—Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\\nthird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton’s knight-errantry\\non the subject.—\\n\\n“Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.—I quite rave\\nabout Jane Fairfax.—A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\\nladylike—and with such talents!—I assure you I think she has very\\nextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\\nwell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\\nis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth—but, upon my word,\\nI talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.—And her situation is so calculated\\nto affect one!—Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to\\ndo something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\\nmust not be suffered to remain unknown.—I dare say you have heard those\\ncharming lines of the poet,\\n\\n‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\n    ‘And waste its fragrance on the desert air.’\\n\\n\\nWe must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.”\\n\\n“I cannot think there is any danger of it,” was Emma’s calm answer—“and\\nwhen you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax’s situation and\\nunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\\nhave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.”\\n\\n“Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\\nobscurity, so thrown away.—Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\\nwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\\nI am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\\nfeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I must\\nconfess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\\ntimidity—and I am sure one does not often meet with it.—But in those\\nwho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\\nyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\\nthan I can express.”\\n\\n“You appear to feel a great deal—but I am not aware how you or any of\\nMiss Fairfax’s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her\\nlonger than yourself, can shew her any other attention than”—\\n\\n“My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\\nact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\\nfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\\nhave carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\\nwhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\\nleast inconvenient.—I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\\nsend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\\nthan Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\\nthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\\nused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\\nother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\\nGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be—for we do not\\nat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.—However, my\\nresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.—I shall certainly have\\nher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\\nhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\\non the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\\nextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her\\nshortly.—I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\\nbrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\\nextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\\nwill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of\\neither but what is highly conciliating.—I shall have her very often\\nindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\\nseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.”\\n\\n“Poor Jane Fairfax!”—thought Emma.—“You have not deserved this. You may\\nhave done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\\nbeyond what you can have merited!—The kindness and protection of Mrs.\\nElton!—‘Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.’ Heavens! Let me not suppose\\nthat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!—But upon my honour,\\nthere seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman’s tongue!”\\n\\nEmma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively\\naddressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a “dear Miss\\nWoodhouse.” The change on Mrs. Elton’s side soon afterwards appeared,\\nand she was left in peace—neither forced to be the very particular\\nfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton’s guidance, the very active\\npatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\\nway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\\n\\nShe looked on with some amusement.—Miss Bates’s gratitude for Mrs.\\nElton’s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\\nsimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies—the most\\namiable, affable, delightful woman—just as accomplished and\\ncondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma’s only\\nsurprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and\\ntolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with\\nthe Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons!\\nThis was astonishing!—She could not have believed it possible that the\\ntaste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and\\nfriendship as the Vicarage had to offer.\\n\\n“She is a riddle, quite a riddle!” said she.—“To chuse to remain here\\nmonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\\nmortification of Mrs. Elton’s notice and the penury of her\\nconversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have\\nalways loved her with such real, generous affection.”\\n\\nJane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\\nwere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\\npromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\\ninvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\\nBates—it all came from her—Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\\nWould Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\\ncontrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\\ndeclined it!\\n\\n“She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\\nthis invitation,” was Emma’s conclusion. “She must be under some sort\\nof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is\\ngreat fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—She is _not_ to\\nbe with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must\\nshe consent to be with the Eltons?—Here is quite a separate puzzle.”\\n\\nUpon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\\nthe few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\\napology for Jane.\\n\\n“We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my\\ndear Emma—but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\\ngood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\\nmust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\\nwhat she goes to.”\\n\\n“You are right, Mrs. Weston,” said Mr. Knightley warmly, “Miss Fairfax\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\nCould she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\\nher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions\\nfrom Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.”\\n\\nEmma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\\nwas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\\nreplied,\\n\\n“Such attentions as Mrs. Elton’s, I should have imagined, would rather\\ndisgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton’s invitations I should\\nhave imagined any thing but inviting.”\\n\\n“I should not wonder,” said Mrs. Weston, “if Miss Fairfax were to have\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s eagerness in\\naccepting Mrs. Elton’s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may very\\nlikely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\\nspite of the very natural wish of a little change.”\\n\\nBoth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\\nminutes silence, he said,\\n\\n“Another thing must be taken into consideration too—Mrs. Elton does not\\ntalk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\\ndifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\\namongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\\ncivility in our personal intercourse with each other—a something more\\nearly implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\\nmay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\\nAnd besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\\nsure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\\nand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\\nrespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\\nnever fell in Mrs. Elton’s way before—and no degree of vanity can\\nprevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\\nnot in consciousness.”\\n\\n“I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,” said Emma. Little Henry\\nwas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\\nirresolute what else to say.\\n\\n“Yes,” he replied, “any body may know how highly I think of her.”\\n\\n“And yet,” said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\\nstopping—it was better, however, to know the worst at once—she hurried\\non—“And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\\nis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\\nother.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\nleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\\nsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\\n\\n“Oh! are you there?—But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\\na hint of it six weeks ago.”\\n\\nHe stopped.—Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\\nherself know what to think. In a moment he went on—\\n\\n“That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\\nsay, would not have me if I were to ask her—and I am very sure I shall\\nnever ask her.”\\n\\nEmma returned her friend’s pressure with interest; and was pleased\\nenough to exclaim,\\n\\n“You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.”\\n\\nHe seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which\\nshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\\n\\n“So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?”\\n\\n“No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just\\nnow, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without\\nany idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the\\nsmallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You\\nwould not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were\\nmarried.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, “No,\\nEmma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\\nme by surprize.—I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\\nyou.” And soon afterwards, “Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\\nwoman—but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\\nnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.”\\n\\nEmma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. “Well,” said\\nshe, “and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\\nwittier than his neighbours.”\\n\\n“In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\\nwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles—what\\nshe calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\\nin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley—what can she do for Mr.\\nCole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her\\ncivilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\\nweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\\nof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\\nMiss Fairfax’s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton’s\\nacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\\nbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\\nI cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\nwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring\\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.”\\n\\n“Jane Fairfax has feeling,” said Mr. Knightley—“I do not accuse her of\\nwant of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong—and her\\ntemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\\nbut it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\\nshe used to be—And I love an open temper. No—till Cole alluded to my\\nsupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\\nand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always—but with no\\nthought beyond.”\\n\\n“Well, Mrs. Weston,” said Emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do\\nyou say now to Mr. Knightley’s marrying Jane Fairfax?”\\n\\n“Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\\nidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\\nwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\\ndisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\\nevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\\nin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\\nnever to have a disengaged day.\\n\\n“I see how it is,” said she. “I see what a life I am to lead among you.\\nUpon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\\nthe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\\nformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\\ndisengaged day!—A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\\nbeen at a loss.”\\n\\nNo invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\\nperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\\ndinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\\nthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\\ncard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\\ngood deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon\\nshew them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the\\nspring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in\\nwhich her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\\nunbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the\\nevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\\nrefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\\n\\nEmma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\\nHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\\nshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\\nresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\\nten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\\nusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\\nwith the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\\n\\nThe persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the Eltons,\\nit must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\\ncourse—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\\nbe asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was not given with\\nequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\\nby Harriet’s begging to be allowed to decline it. “She would rather not\\nbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite able\\nto see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\\nuncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\\nrather stay at home.” It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\\nshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\\nfortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to\\ngive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.—\\nSince her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she was\\nmore conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\\nbeen.—Mr. Knightley’s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\\nFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\\n\\n“This is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which\\nwas all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—Of the same age—and\\nalways knowing her—I ought to have been more her friend.—She will never\\nlike me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her greater\\nattention than I have done.”\\n\\nEvery invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\\nhappy.—The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\\nover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\\nKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\\nweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\\nstaying one whole day at Hartfield—which one day would be the very day\\nof this party.—His professional engagements did not allow of his being\\nput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\\nso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\\nutmost that his nerves could bear—and here would be a ninth—and Emma\\napprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\\nbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\\nfalling in with a dinner-party.\\n\\nShe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\\nrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he\\nalways said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\\nimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\\nhave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\\ninstead of his brother.\\n\\nThe event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\\nKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\\nmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\\nevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\\nand the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\\nphilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\\nchief of even Emma’s vexation.\\n\\nThe day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\\nKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\\nagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\\nwaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as\\nelegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\\nsilence—wanting only to observe enough for Isabella’s information—but\\nMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could\\ntalk to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a\\nwalk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It\\nwas natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\\n\\n“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\\nsure you must have been wet.—We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\\nturned directly.”\\n\\n“I went only to the post-office,” said she, “and reached home before\\nthe rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters\\nwhen I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A\\nwalk before breakfast does me good.”\\n\\n“Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.”\\n\\n“No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.”\\n\\nMr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\\n\\n“That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six\\nyards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and\\nHenry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.\\nThe post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you\\nhave lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth\\ngoing through the rain for.”\\n\\nThere was a little blush, and then this answer,\\n\\n“I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\\ndearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\\nolder should make me indifferent about letters.”\\n\\n“Indifferent! Oh! no—I never conceived you could become indifferent.\\nLetters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\\npositive curse.”\\n\\n“You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\\nfriendship.”\\n\\n“I have often thought them the worst of the two,” replied he coolly.\\n“Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.”\\n\\n“Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well—I am\\nvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\\ncan easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\\nto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes\\nthe difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every body\\ndearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and\\ntherefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I\\nthink, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\\nto-day.”\\n\\n“When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of\\nyears,” said John Knightley, “I meant to imply the change of situation\\nwhich time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time\\nwill generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the\\ndaily circle—but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an\\nold friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years\\nhence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.”\\n\\nIt was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant “thank\\nyou” seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\\nin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\\nnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on\\nsuch occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his\\nparticular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her—and with all\\nhis mildest urbanity, said,\\n\\n“I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\\nin the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.—Young ladies\\nare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\\ncomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\\nsolicitude about me.”\\n\\n“My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.—I\\nhope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\\nold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\\ndo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I are\\nboth highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\\nsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.”\\n\\nThe kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\\nhad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\\n\\nBy this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\\nremonstrances now opened upon Jane.\\n\\n“My dear Jane, what is this I hear?—Going to the post-office in the\\nrain!—This must not be, I assure you.—You sad girl, how could you do\\nsuch a thing?—It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.”\\n\\nJane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\\n\\n“Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\\nhow to take care of yourself.—To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\\ndid you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\\nauthority.”\\n\\n“My advice,” said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, “I certainly do\\nfeel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.—Liable\\nas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\\ncareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\\nrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\\nhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your\\ncough again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are\\nmuch too reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,” eagerly rejoined Mrs.\\nElton. “We will not allow her to do such a thing again:”—and nodding\\nsignificantly—“there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\\nI shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\\n(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\\nbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and\\nfrom _us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to\\naccept such an accommodation.”\\n\\n“You are extremely kind,” said Jane; “but I cannot give up my early\\nwalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\\nsomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\\nscarcely ever had a bad morning before.”\\n\\n“My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\\n(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\\nwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\\nyou and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\\nmyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\\nmeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\\nsettled.”\\n\\n“Excuse me,” said Jane earnestly, “I cannot by any means consent to\\nsuch an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the\\nerrand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is\\nwhen I am not here, by my grandmama’s.”\\n\\n“Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!—And it is a kindness to\\nemploy our men.”\\n\\nJane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\\nanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\\n\\n“The post-office is a wonderful establishment!” said she.—“The\\nregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\\nand all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!”\\n\\n“It is certainly very well regulated.”\\n\\n“So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that a\\nletter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\\nkingdom, is even carried wrong—and not one in a million, I suppose,\\nactually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\\nhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.”\\n\\n“The clerks grow expert from habit.—They must begin with some quickness\\nof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\\nexplanation,” continued he, smiling, “they are paid for it. That is the\\nkey to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\\nwell.”\\n\\nThe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\\nobservations made.\\n\\n“I have heard it asserted,” said John Knightley, “that the same sort of\\nhandwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\\nteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\\nthe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have\\nvery little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand\\nthey can get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I\\nhave not always known their writing apart.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. I know what\\nyou mean—but Emma’s hand is the strongest.”\\n\\n“Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,” said Mr. Woodhouse; “and\\nalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston”—with half a sigh and half a\\nsmile at her.\\n\\n“I never saw any gentleman’s handwriting”—Emma began, looking also at\\nMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\\nto some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect, “Now, how am I\\ngoing to introduce him?—Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\\nbefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\\nphrase?—Your Yorkshire friend—your correspondent in Yorkshire;—that\\nwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.—No, I can pronounce\\nhis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\\nbetter.—Now for it.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—“Mr. Frank Churchill\\nwrites one of the best gentleman’s hands I ever saw.”\\n\\n“I do not admire it,” said Mr. Knightley. “It is too small—wants\\nstrength. It is like a woman’s writing.”\\n\\nThis was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\\nthe base aspersion. “No, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a\\nlarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston\\nany letter about her to produce?” No, she had heard from him very\\nlately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.\\n\\n“If we were in the other room,” said Emma, “if I had my writing-desk, I\\nam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.—Do not you\\nremember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?”\\n\\n“He chose to say he was employed”—\\n\\n“Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\\nMr. Knightley.”\\n\\n“Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,” said Mr.\\nKnightley dryly, “writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will,\\nof course, put forth his best.”\\n\\nDinner was on table.—Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\\nready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\\nallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying—\\n\\n“Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.”\\n\\nJane’s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\\nShe had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\\nthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\\n_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in\\nfull expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had\\nnot been in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness\\nthan usual—a glow both of complexion and spirits.\\n\\nShe could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\\nexpense of the Irish mails;—it was at her tongue’s end—but she\\nabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should\\nhurt Jane Fairfax’s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of\\nthe room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming\\nto the beauty and grace of each.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found\\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with\\nso much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\\nJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be\\nalmost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\\nleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon\\nbegan again; and though much that passed between them was in a\\nhalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton’s side, there was no avoiding a\\nknowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office—catching\\ncold—fetching letters—and friendship, were long under discussion; and\\nto them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to\\nJane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\\nsuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton’s meditated activity.\\n\\n“Here is April come!” said she, “I get quite anxious about you. June\\nwill soon be here.”\\n\\n“But I have never fixed on June or any other month—merely looked\\nforward to the summer in general.”\\n\\n“But have you really heard of nothing?”\\n\\n“I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.”\\n\\n“Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\\ndifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.”\\n\\n“I not aware!” said Jane, shaking her head; “dear Mrs. Elton, who can\\nhave thought of it as I have done?”\\n\\n“But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\\nhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\\na vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\\nMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\\nbody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first\\ncircle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable!\\nOf all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge’s is the one I would most wish\\nto see you in.”\\n\\n“Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,” said\\nJane. “I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\\nit;—afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\\nnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.”\\n\\n“Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\\ntrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\\nmore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\\na day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\\nfor any thing eligible.”\\n\\n“Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her;\\ntill the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\\ntrouble.”\\n\\n“But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\\nor say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\\nus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you\\ndeserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday\\noccurrence, is not obtained at a moment’s notice; indeed, indeed, we\\nmust begin inquiring directly.”\\n\\n“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\\ninquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.\\nWhen I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of\\nbeing long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\\nwould soon produce something—Offices for the sale—not quite of human\\nflesh—but of human intellect.”\\n\\n“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\\nthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend\\nto the abolition.”\\n\\n“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane;\\n“governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\\ndifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\\nthe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I\\nonly mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\\napplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\\nsomething that would do.”\\n\\n“Something that would do!” repeated Mrs. Elton. “Aye, _that_ may suit\\nyour humble ideas of yourself;—I know what a modest creature you are;\\nbut it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\\nthing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\\nnot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\\nlife.”\\n\\n“You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it\\nwould be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\\nthink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\\nA gentleman’s family is all that I should condition for.”\\n\\n“I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\\nbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\\non my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\\nfirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\\nyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\\nas much as you chose;—that is—I do not know—if you knew the harp, you\\nmight do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;—yes, I\\nreally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you\\nchose;—and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\\ncomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.”\\n\\n“You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a\\nsituation together,” said Jane, “they are pretty sure to be equal;\\nhowever, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at\\npresent for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\\nobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\\nnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\\nshall remain where I am, and as I am.”\\n\\n“And I am quite serious too, I assure you,” replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\\n“in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\\nwatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.”\\n\\nIn this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till\\nMr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of\\nobject, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\\n\\n“Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!—Only think of his\\ngallantry in coming away before the other men!—what a dear creature he\\nis;—I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\\nold-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\\nmodern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\\nyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\\nbegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am\\nrather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\\nit?—Selina’s choice—handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is\\nnot over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\\nover-trimmed—quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\\nnow, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\\na bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of\\ndress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\\nminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show\\nand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\\ntrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\\nlook well?”\\n\\nThe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\\nWeston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late\\ndinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too\\nmuch expected by the best judges, for surprize—but there was great joy.\\nMr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been\\nsorry to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute\\nastonishment.—That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at\\nhome after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk\\nhalf a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being in mixed\\ncompany till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility\\nand the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A\\nman who had been in motion since eight o’clock in the morning, and\\nmight now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have\\nbeen silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been\\nalone!—Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own\\nfireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again\\ninto the world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\\nback his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would\\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley looked\\nat him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, “I could\\nnot have believed it even of _him_.”\\n\\nMr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\\nexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\\nprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\\nmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\\ninquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\\nher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\\nabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\\ncommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\\nhad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\\nthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\\nhad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\\n\\n“Read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few\\nlines—will not take you long; read it to Emma.”\\n\\nThe two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\\nto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible\\nto every body.\\n\\n“Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\\nto it?—I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?—Anne,\\nmy dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?—In\\ntown next week, you see—at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\\nimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\\nlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\\nnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\\nagain, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\\nand he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\\nWell, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\\nit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\\nother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\\ncircumstance to the others in a common way.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks and\\nwords had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\\nhappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm\\nand open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little\\noccupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the\\ndegree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\\n\\nMr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\\nto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\\n\\nIt was well that he took every body’s joy for granted, or he might not\\nhave thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\\ndelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\\nbe made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\\nshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\\nbeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\\nElton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the\\nsubject with her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\n“I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,”\\nsaid Mr. Weston.\\n\\nMrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\\nher by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\\n\\n“You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,” he\\ncontinued—“and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\\nElton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\\npleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.”\\n\\n“You are very obliging.—Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.— He\\nis to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\\nletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\\nson’s hand, presumed to open it—though it was not directed to me—it was\\nto Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\\nhardly ever get a letter.”\\n\\n“And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\\nWeston—(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.—A most\\ndangerous precedent indeed!—I beg you will not let your neighbours\\nfollow your example.—Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\\nmarried women must begin to exert ourselves!—Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\\nnot have believed it of you!”\\n\\n“Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\\nElton.—This letter tells us—it is a short letter—written in a hurry,\\nmerely to give us notice—it tells us that they are all coming up to\\ntown directly, on Mrs. Churchill’s account—she has not been well the\\nwhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to\\nmove southward without loss of time.”\\n\\n“Indeed!—from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?”\\n\\n“Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\\nconsiderable journey.”\\n\\n“Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\\nfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\\nof large fortune?—You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\\nSuckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me—but twice\\nin one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\\nhorses.”\\n\\n“The evil of the distance from Enscombe,” said Mr. Weston, “is, that\\nMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\\nsofa for a week together. In Frank’s last letter she complained, he\\nsaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\nboth his arm and his uncle’s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\\nweakness—but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\\nsleep only two nights on the road.—So Frank writes word. Certainly,\\ndelicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\\nmust grant me that.”\\n\\n“No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\\nown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice—You will find me a formidable\\nantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women—and I assure you,\\nif you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\\nwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill’s making incredible exertions to\\navoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her—and I believe I have\\ncaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\\nan excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?”\\n\\n“Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\\nlady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the\\nland for”—\\n\\nMrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\\n\\n“Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\\nyou. Do not run away with such an idea.”\\n\\n“Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\\na fine lady as any body ever beheld.”\\n\\nMrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\\nIt was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\\n_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\\nit;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\\nWeston went on.\\n\\n“Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but\\nthis is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\\ntherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\\nnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I\\nwould not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith\\nin Mrs. Churchill’s illness.”\\n\\n“If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?—To Bath, or to\\nClifton?” “She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\\nher. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\\nbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\\nbegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\\nretired.”\\n\\n“Aye—like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\\nthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\\nseem shut out from every thing—in the most complete retirement.—And\\nMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\\nthat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough\\nin herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman\\ncannot have too many resources—and I feel very thankful that I have so\\nmany myself as to be quite independent of society.”\\n\\n“Frank was here in February for a fortnight.”\\n\\n“So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\\nof Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\\nmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\\nsuch a creature in the world.”\\n\\nThis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\\nWeston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\\n\\n“My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing\\npossible. Not heard of you!—I believe Mrs. Weston’s letters lately have\\nbeen full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.”\\n\\nHe had done his duty and could return to his son.\\n\\n“When Frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we\\nmight see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome. It has\\nbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\\nhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\\nup—but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\\ndesponding. ‘How could he contrive to come? And how could it be\\nsupposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—I\\nalways felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has,\\nyou see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if\\nthings are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”\\n\\n“Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say\\nto a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when,\\nbecause things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the\\nrapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and\\nexclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen’s\\nsaffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to\\ndispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The\\ncarriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning, I\\nremember, he came to me quite in despair.”\\n\\nShe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\\nseized the opportunity of going on.\\n\\n“You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is\\nordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\\nEnscombe—in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\\nprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring—precisely the\\nseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\\nthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\\nnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\\nof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there\\nalways is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\\nintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\\ndo not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\\nsort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\\nto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\\nhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\\npleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\\nthought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston’s\\npartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\\ngratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.”\\n\\n“And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\\nwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\\nFrank Churchill.—At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\\nof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means\\nimplicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son,\\nso I shall judge of him.—I am no flatterer.”\\n\\nMr. Weston was musing.\\n\\n“I hope,” said he presently, “I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\\nChurchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\\nthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me\\nto speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be\\nignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the\\ntreatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of\\nit is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank’s mother would\\nnever have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has\\npride; but his pride is nothing to his wife’s: his is a quiet,\\nindolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only\\nmake himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance\\nand insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair\\npretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely\\nthe daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a\\nChurchill she has out-Churchill’d them all in high and mighty claims:\\nbut in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.”\\n\\n“Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a\\nhorror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\\npeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\\nare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\\nthemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\\ndirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\\nencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense\\nairs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established\\nfamilies. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived\\nat West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came\\nfrom Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr.\\nWeston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is\\nsomething direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of\\nthe Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\\nyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my\\nbrother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\\nneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\\nyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him—I\\nbelieve, at least—I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\\nthe purchase before his death.”\\n\\nThey were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\\nsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\\nWoodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\\nand Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\\nlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\\nnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of\\nspirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\\n\\nMr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\\nleave them early the next day; and he soon began with—\\n\\n“Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\\nboys; but you have your sister’s letter, and every thing is down at\\nfull length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise\\nthan her’s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have\\nto recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\\nthem.”\\n\\n“I rather hope to satisfy you both,” said Emma, “for I shall do all in\\nmy power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\\nhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.”\\n\\n“And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.”\\n\\n“That is very likely. You think so, do not you?”\\n\\n“I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father—or even\\nmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue\\nto increase as much as they have done lately.”\\n\\n“Increase!”\\n\\n“Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\\ngreat difference in your way of life.”\\n\\n“Difference! No indeed I am not.”\\n\\n“There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\\nthan you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for\\nonly one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!—When did it\\nhappen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing,\\nand you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella\\nbrought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole’s, or balls\\nat the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in\\nyour goings-on, is very great.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said his brother quickly, “it is Randalls that does it all.”\\n\\n“Very well—and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\\ninfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\\nthat Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I\\nonly beg you to send them home.”\\n\\n“No,” cried Mr. Knightley, “that need not be the consequence. Let them\\nbe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” exclaimed Emma, “you amuse me! I should like to know\\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\\nof the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\\nto attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine—what\\nhave they been? Dining once with the Coles—and having a ball talked of,\\nwhich never took place. I can understand you—(nodding at Mr. John\\nKnightley)—your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\\nonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning\\nto Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours\\nfrom Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for\\nme, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that\\nif Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much\\nbetter with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours\\nwhere she is absent one—and who, when he is at home, is either reading\\nto himself or settling his accounts.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\\ndifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton’s beginning to talk to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVOLUME III\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\n\\nA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\\nwas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\\napprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\\nreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but\\nif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\\ntwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he\\nhad taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\\nmonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\\nher:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did not\\nmean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\\nincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\\n\\nShe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\\nThat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\\nacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\\ndecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\\ncrisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and\\ntranquil state.\\n\\nIt was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had\\nforeseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank\\nChurchill’s feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so\\nsoon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.\\nHe rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he\\ncame from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise\\nall her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was\\ninfluenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost\\nfriendliness. There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing\\nher. But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\\nhad done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. She\\nwatched him well. It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had\\nbeen. Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had\\nproduced this very natural and very desirable effect.\\n\\nHe was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and\\nhe was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\\nhis comparative indifference. He was not calm; his spirits were\\nevidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he\\nwas, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what\\ndecided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an\\nhour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. “He had seen a\\ngroup of old acquaintance in the street as he passed—he had not\\nstopped, he would not stop for more than a word—but he had the vanity\\nto think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he\\nwished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.” She had no\\ndoubt as to his being less in love—but neither his agitated spirits,\\nnor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather\\ninclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a\\ndiscreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.\\n\\nThis was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\\nHe was often hoping, intending to come—but was always prevented. His\\naunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\\nRandall’s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\\nto be inferred that Mrs. Churchill’s removal to London had been of no\\nservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\\nreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,\\nat Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he\\nlooked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been\\nhalf a year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that\\ncare and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have\\nmany years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,\\nby all his father’s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely\\nimaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.\\n\\nIt soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could not\\nendure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\\nsuffering; and by the ten days’ end, her nephew’s letter to Randalls\\ncommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\\nRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\\nan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\\nready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\\nexpected from the change.\\n\\nEmma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\\nbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the\\nhouse was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\\nthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\\ncould even wish.\\n\\nEmma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\\nhoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\\n\\nMr. Weston’s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted. It\\nwas the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\\nreally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a\\nyoung man?—An hour’s ride. He would be always coming over. The\\ndifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\\nthe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\\nmiles—nay, eighteen—it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street—was a\\nserious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be spent\\nin coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London;\\nhe might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for\\neasy intercourse. Better than nearer!\\n\\nOne good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\\nremoval,—the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but\\nit had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\\nhowever, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\\nvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines\\nfrom Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the\\nchange, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for\\ntwenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a\\nday as possible.\\n\\nMr. Weston’s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\\nspend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have\\nany thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nNo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\\nthe day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\\nChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\\nbefore dinner, and every thing was safe.\\n\\nNo second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at\\nthe Crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common\\nmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort\\nof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse\\nhim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man’s\\ncompany. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good\\ntime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\\n\\nFrank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it\\nshould be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of\\nanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,\\nwithout great surprize. “So unreasonably early!” she was going to\\nexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,\\nwho were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.\\nWeston’s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another\\ncarriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same\\ndistinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if\\nhalf the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of\\npreparatory inspection.\\n\\nEmma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.\\nWeston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a\\nman who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\\ndistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a\\nlittle less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\\ncharacter.—General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man\\nwhat he ought to be.—She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked\\nabout, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to\\ndo, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a\\nfire in the evening was still very pleasant.\\n\\nEmma found that it was not Mr. Weston’s fault that the number of privy\\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates’s door\\nto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\\nbrought by the Eltons.\\n\\nFrank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\\nthe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,—impatient\\nto begin, or afraid of being always near her.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was spoken of. “I think she must be here soon,” said he. “I\\nhave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\\nIt cannot be long, I think, before she comes.”\\n\\nA carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\\nsaid,\\n\\n“I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\\neither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\\npassed.\\n\\n“But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!” said Mr. Weston, looking about. “We\\nthought you were to bring them.”\\n\\nThe mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\\nlonged to know what Frank’s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\\nby giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.—Somebody talked of rain.—“I\\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,” said Frank to his father:\\n“Miss Bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. Mr. Weston was\\nfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\\nof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\\nthough by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\\n\\n“A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\\nI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\\npleased with him.—You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a\\nvery handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\\napprove—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them.\\nThey were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me\\nhad ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\\nmuch better.”\\n\\nWhile she talked of his son, Mr. Weston’s attention was chained; but\\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\\n\\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. “I have no doubt of its being our\\ncarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\\nextremely expeditious!—I believe we drive faster than any body.—What a\\npleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—I understand you\\nwere so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite\\nunnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.”\\n\\nMiss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\\nthe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\\nWeston’s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be\\nunderstood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every\\nbody’s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,\\nwho came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes\\nafter her being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door\\nopened she was heard,\\n\\n“So very obliging of you!—No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\\ncare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares—Well!—(as soon as\\nshe was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!—This is\\nadmirable!—Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\\nnot have imagined it.—So well lighted up!—Jane, Jane, look!—did you\\never see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin’s\\nlamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\\nI came in; she was standing in the entrance. ‘Oh! Mrs. Stokes,’ said\\nI—but I had not time for more.” She was now met by Mrs. Weston.—“Very\\nwell, I thank you, ma’am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\\nit. So afraid you might have a headache!—seeing you pass by so often,\\nand knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it\\nindeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the\\ncarriage!—excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the\\nhorses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.—Oh! and I am sure our\\nthanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most\\nkindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.—But two such offers in\\none day!—Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, ‘Upon my\\nword, ma’am—.’ Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr.\\nWoodhouse’s. I made her take her shawl—for the evenings are not\\nwarm—her large new shawl— Mrs. Dixon’s wedding-present.—So kind of her\\nto think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know—Mr. Dixon’s choice.\\nThere were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some\\ntime. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you\\nsure you did not wet your feet?—It was but a drop or two, but I am so\\nafraid:—but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely—and there was a mat to\\nstep upon—I shall never forget his extreme politeness.—Oh! Mr. Frank\\nChurchill, I must tell you my mother’s spectacles have never been in\\nfault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\\nyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?—Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill?—Ah! here’s Miss Woodhouse.—Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you\\ndo?—Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in\\nfairy-land!—Such a transformation!—Must not compliment, I know (eyeing\\nEmma most complacently)—that would be rude—but upon my word, Miss\\nWoodhouse, you do look—how do you like Jane’s hair?—You are a\\njudge.—She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\\nhair!—No hairdresser from London I think could.—Ah! Dr. Hughes I\\ndeclare—and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\\nmoment.—How do you do? How do you do?—Very well, I thank you. This is\\ndelightful, is not it?—Where’s dear Mr. Richard?—Oh! there he is. Don’t\\ndisturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do\\nyou do, Mr. Richard?—I saw you the other day as you rode through the\\ntown—Mrs. Otway, I protest!—and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss\\nCaroline.—Such a host of friends!—and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!—How do\\nyou do? How do you all do?—Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never\\nbetter.—Don’t I hear another carriage?—Who can this be?—very likely the\\nworthy Coles.—Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among\\nsuch friends! And such a noble fire!—I am quite roasted. No coffee, I\\nthank you, for me—never take coffee.—A little tea if you please, sir,\\nby and bye,—no hurry—Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!”\\n\\nFrank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\\nBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the\\ndiscourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little\\nway behind her.—He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she\\ncould not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress\\nand look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was\\nevidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was, “How do you\\nlike my gown?—How do you like my trimming?—How has Wright done my\\nhair?”—with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\\npoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, “Nobody can think less of dress in\\ngeneral than I do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s\\neyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons—who I have\\nno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—I would not wish\\nto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\\nmine.—So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.—We shall\\nsee if our styles suit.—A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\\nI like him very well.”\\n\\nAt this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\\nbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\\nmore;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\\nanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton’s tones again distinctly\\nforward.—Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\\n\\n“Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?—I was\\nthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\\ntidings of us.”\\n\\n“Jane!”—repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\\ndispleasure.—“That is easy—but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\\nsuppose.”\\n\\n“How do you like Mrs. Elton?” said Emma in a whisper.\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“You are ungrateful.”\\n\\n“Ungrateful!—What do you mean?” Then changing from a frown to a\\nsmile—“No, do not tell me—I do not want to know what you mean.—Where is\\nmy father?—When are we to begin dancing?”\\n\\nEmma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\\noff to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\\nMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\\nlaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\\nmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\\ninterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.—Emma\\nheard the sad truth with fortitude.\\n\\n“And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said Mr. Weston.\\n“She will think Frank ought to ask her.”\\n\\nFrank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\\nboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\\nperfect approbation of—and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\\nwanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\\nwas to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.—Mr.\\nWeston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\\nWoodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was\\nalmost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly\\nthe advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though\\nshe had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by\\nthe change. Mr. Weston might be his son’s superior.—In spite of this\\nlittle rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see\\nthe respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that\\nshe had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.—She was more\\ndisturbed by Mr. Knightley’s not dancing than by any thing else.—There\\nhe was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be\\ndancing,—not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and\\nwhist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance\\ntill their rubbers were made up,—so young as he looked!—He could not\\nhave appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had\\nplaced himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms\\nand stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must\\ndraw every body’s eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not\\none among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.—He\\nmoved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in\\nhow gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have\\ndanced, would he but take the trouble.—Whenever she caught his eye, she\\nforced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he\\ncould love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.—He\\nseemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he\\nthought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she\\ndid not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and\\nher partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.\\nThat Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was\\nindubitable.\\n\\nThe ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\\nattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\\nhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\\nbestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\\nthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\\nrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings\\nusually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something\\nof.—The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\\npartner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been\\nhitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one\\ndisengaged was the wonder!—But Emma’s wonder lessened soon afterwards,\\non seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance\\nif it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she\\nwas expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.\\n\\nEscape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room\\nwhere the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in\\nfront of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of\\nmaintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss\\nSmith, or speaking to those who were close to her.—Emma saw it. She was\\nnot yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had\\ntherefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little\\nshe saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were\\nexactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch;\\nbut Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue\\nwhich just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she\\nperceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was\\nnot only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant\\nglances.—The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join\\nhim and say, “Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?” to which his prompt reply\\nwas, “Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.”\\n\\n“Me!—oh! no—I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\\ndancer.”\\n\\n“If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “I shall have great\\npleasure, I am sure—for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\\nmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\\ngreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\\nGilbert.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\\ndisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing—Miss Smith.” “Miss\\nSmith!—oh!—I had not observed.—You are extremely obliging—and if I were\\nnot an old married man.—But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You\\nwill excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\\ncommand—but my dancing days are over.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\\nmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton!\\nthe amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.—She looked round for a moment;\\nhe had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging\\nhimself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed\\nbetween him and his wife.\\n\\nShe would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\\nface might be as hot.\\n\\nIn another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr. Knightley leading\\nHarriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\\ndelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\\nboth for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\\ntoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\\ncatch his eye again.\\n\\nHis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\\nand Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\\nthe cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\\nand very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\\nannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\\nflew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\\n\\nMr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\\nfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\\ngrowing very like her;—_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\\naudibly to her partner,\\n\\n“Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!—Very good-natured,\\nI declare.”\\n\\nSupper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard\\nfrom that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table\\nand taking up her spoon.\\n\\n“Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?—Here is your tippet. Mrs.\\nWeston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there\\nwill be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—One\\ndoor nailed up—Quantities of matting—My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr.\\nChurchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!—so\\ngratified! Excellent dancing indeed!—Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\\nsaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody\\nmissed me.—I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\\nGrandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\\nvast deal of chat, and backgammon.—Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\\nand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of\\nher throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\\namused, and who were your partners. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘I shall not\\nforestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love\\nto tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.\\nElton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.’\\nMy dear sir, you are too obliging.—Is there nobody you would not\\nrather?—I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane\\non one arm, and me on the other!—Stop, stop, let us stand a little\\nback, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she\\nlooks!—Beautiful lace!—Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen\\nof the evening!—Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take\\ncare of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded\\nthere were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there\\nis but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and\\nstyle—Candles everywhere.—I was telling you of your grandmama,\\nJane,—There was a little disappointment.—The baked apples and biscuits,\\nexcellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of\\nsweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr.\\nWoodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all\\nout again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread\\nand asparagus—so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would\\nnot speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss\\nWoodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!—Well, this is\\nbrilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!—Such\\nelegance and profusion!—I have seen nothing like it since—Well, where\\nshall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a\\ndraught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this\\nside?—Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill—only it seems too good—but just as\\nyou please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane,\\nhow shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too!\\nBless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent,\\nand I cannot help beginning.”\\n\\nEmma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\\nbut, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him\\nirresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\\nreprobation of Mr. Elton’s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\\nand Mrs. Elton’s looks also received the due share of censure.\\n\\n“They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,” said he. “Emma, why is it\\nthat they are your enemies?”\\n\\nHe looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\\n“_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\\nbe.—To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\\nthat you did want him to marry Harriet.”\\n\\n“I did,” replied Emma, “and they cannot forgive me.”\\n\\nHe shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\\nonly said,\\n\\n“I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.”\\n\\n“Can you trust me with such flatterers?—Does my vain spirit ever tell\\nme I am wrong?”\\n\\n“Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.—If one leads you wrong,\\nI am sure the other tells you of it.”\\n\\n“I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There\\nis a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not:\\nand I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was\\nthrough a series of strange blunders!”\\n\\n“And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\\njustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\\nchosen for himself.—Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\\nMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\\ngirl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\\nwoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.”\\n\\nEmma was extremely gratified.—They were interrupted by the bustle of\\nMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\\n\\n“Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\\ndoing?—Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\\nEvery body is asleep!”\\n\\n“I am ready,” said Emma, “whenever I am wanted.”\\n\\n“Whom are you going to dance with?” asked Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nShe hesitated a moment, and then replied, “With you, if you will ask\\nme.”\\n\\n“Will you?” said he, offering his hand.\\n\\n“Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\\nnot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.”\\n\\n“Brother and sister! no, indeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\\npleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\\nshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.—She was extremely\\nglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\\nEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\\nalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\\npeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\\nminutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\\noccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\\nto another happy result—the cure of Harriet’s infatuation.—From\\nHarriet’s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted\\nthe ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were\\nsuddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the\\nsuperior creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma\\ncould harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by\\ninjurious courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\\nsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\\nrequisite.—Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\\nMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\\nmust be before her!\\n\\nShe was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that\\nhe could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he\\nwas to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\\n\\nHaving arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them\\nall to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened\\nup for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their\\ngrandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons\\nentered whom she had never less expected to see together—Frank\\nChurchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm—actually Harriet!—A moment\\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\\nHarriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer\\nher.—The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards\\nasunder;—they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately\\nsinking into a chair fainted away.\\n\\nA young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\\nand surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\\nsuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\\nwith the whole.\\n\\nMiss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\\nGoddard’s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\\ntaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\\nfor safety, had led them into alarm.—About half a mile beyond Highbury,\\nmaking a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\\nfor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had\\nadvanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\\ndistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\\nparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\\nMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and\\ncalling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight\\nhedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to\\nHighbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much\\nfrom cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank\\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in\\nthis state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\\n\\nHow the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\\ncourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\\nnot be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen\\nchildren, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and\\nimpertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.—More and more\\nfrightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her\\npurse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to\\nuse her ill.—She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was\\nmoving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was\\nfollowed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\\n\\nIn this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\\nconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\\nleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\\nat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\\nhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\\na mile or two beyond Highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of\\nscissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\\nrestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\\nfew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on\\nfoot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\\nterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\\ntheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\\neagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\\nenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome. It\\nwas his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\\nplace.\\n\\nThis was the amount of the whole story,—of his communication and of\\nHarriet’s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.—He dared\\nnot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not\\nanother minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\\nsafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\\nin the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the\\ngrateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\\n\\nSuch an adventure as this,—a fine young man and a lovely young woman\\nthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\\nideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\\nleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\\nhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\\nheard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\\nat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?—How much\\nmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\\nforesight!—especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\\nmind had already made.\\n\\nIt was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\\nrencontre, no alarm of the kind;—and now it had happened to the very\\nperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\\nto pass by to rescue her!—It certainly was very extraordinary!—And\\nknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\\nperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\\nattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr.\\nElton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most\\ninteresting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence\\nshould not be strongly recommending each to the other.\\n\\nIn the few minutes’ conversation which she had yet had with him, while\\nHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror, her\\nnaïveté, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\\nsensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet’s own\\naccount had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\\nabominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing\\nwas to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\\nShe would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\\ninterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive\\nscheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account\\nproceed.\\n\\nEmma’s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\\nwhat had passed,—aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\\nshe soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\\nit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\\nwho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\\nthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last\\nnight’s ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as\\nhe sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without\\ntheir promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some\\ncomfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse\\n(for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well\\nas Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\\nthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\\nindifferent—which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\\nand Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\\nan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for\\nshe hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\\nillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\\n\\nThe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\\nthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\\ndwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\\nnephews:—in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\\nJohn were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\\ngipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\\nslightest particular from the original recital.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\\nmorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\\nand hesitating, thus began:\\n\\n“Miss Woodhouse—if you are at leisure—I have something that I should\\nlike to tell you—a sort of confession to make—and then, you know, it\\nwill be over.”\\n\\nEmma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\\nseriousness in Harriet’s manner which prepared her, quite as much as\\nher words, for something more than ordinary.\\n\\n“It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,” she continued, “to have\\nno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\\ncreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the\\nsatisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\\nnecessary—I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\\nI dare say you understand me.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Emma, “I hope I do.”\\n\\n“How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...” cried Harriet,\\nwarmly. “It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\\nin him now.—I do not care whether I meet him or not—except that of the\\ntwo I had rather not see him—and indeed I would go any distance round\\nto avoid him—but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\\nher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\\nall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable—I shall\\nnever forget her look the other night!—However, I assure you, Miss\\nWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.—No, let them be ever so happy together,\\nit will not give me another moment’s pang: and to convince you that I\\nhave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy—what I ought to\\nhave destroyed long ago—what I ought never to have kept—I know that\\nvery well (blushing as she spoke).—However, now I will destroy it\\nall—and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\\nmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\\nholds?” said she, with a conscious look.\\n\\n“Not the least in the world.—Did he ever give you any thing?”\\n\\n“No—I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\\nvery much.”\\n\\nShe held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\\n_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\\nHarriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\\nabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which\\nHarriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\\nexcepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\\n\\n“Now,” said Harriet, “you _must_ recollect.”\\n\\n“No, indeed I do not.”\\n\\n“Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\\npassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\\ntimes we ever met in it!—It was but a very few days before I had my\\nsore throat—just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came—I think the\\nvery evening.—Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\\npenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?—But, as you had none\\nabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\\nmine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\\ncut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before\\nhe gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help\\nmaking a treasure of it—so I put it by never to be used, and looked at\\nit now and then as a great treat.”\\n\\n“My dearest Harriet!” cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and\\njumping up, “you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\\nRemember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\\nrelic—I knew nothing of that till this moment—but the cutting the\\nfinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about\\nme!—Oh! my sins, my sins!—And I had plenty all the while in my\\npocket!—One of my senseless tricks!—I deserve to be under a continual\\nblush all the rest of my life.—Well—(sitting down again)—go on—what\\nelse?”\\n\\n“And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\\nit, you did it so naturally.”\\n\\n“And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!”\\nsaid Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\nbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, “Lord\\nbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\\npiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\\nnever was equal to this.”\\n\\n“Here,” resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, “here is something\\nstill more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\\nthis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\\nnever did.”\\n\\nEmma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of\\nan old pencil,—the part without any lead.\\n\\n“This was really his,” said Harriet.—“Do not you remember one\\nmorning?—no, I dare say you do not. But one morning—I forget exactly\\nthe day—but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\\n_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\\nabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\\nbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\\nhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\\nit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\\ntable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\\ndared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.”\\n\\n“I do remember it,” cried Emma; “I perfectly remember it.—Talking about\\nspruce-beer.—Oh! yes—Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and\\nMr. Elton’s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly\\nremember it.—Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I\\nhave an idea he was standing just here.”\\n\\n“Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.—It is very odd, but I cannot\\nrecollect.—Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\\nam now.”—\\n\\n“Well, go on.”\\n\\n“Oh! that’s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say—except that\\nI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to\\nsee me do it.”\\n\\n“My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\\ntreasuring up these things?”\\n\\n“Yes, simpleton as I was!—but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\\ncould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\\nknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was—but\\nhad not resolution enough to part with them.”\\n\\n“But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?—I have not a\\nword to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\\nuseful.”\\n\\n“I shall be happier to burn it,” replied Harriet. “It has a\\ndisagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.—There it goes,\\nand there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.”\\n\\n“And when,” thought Emma, “will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?”\\n\\nShe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\\nalready made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had\\n_told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet’s.—About a\\nfortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and\\nquite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which\\nmade the information she received more valuable. She merely said, in\\nthe course of some trivial chat, “Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I\\nwould advise you to do so and so”—and thought no more of it, till after\\na minute’s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, “I\\nshall never marry.”\\n\\nEmma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\\nmoment’s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not,\\nreplied,\\n\\n“Never marry!—This is a new resolution.”\\n\\n“It is one that I shall never change, however.”\\n\\nAfter another short hesitation, “I hope it does not proceed from—I hope\\nit is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?”\\n\\n“Mr. Elton indeed!” cried Harriet indignantly.—“Oh! no”—and Emma could\\njust catch the words, “so superior to Mr. Elton!”\\n\\nShe then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\\nfarther?—should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?—Perhaps\\nHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she\\nwere totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to\\nhear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had\\nbeen, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she\\nwas perfectly resolved.—She believed it would be wiser for her to say\\nand know at once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was\\nalways best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed,\\non any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have\\nthe judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.—She was\\ndecided, and thus spoke—\\n\\n“Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\\nresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\\nan idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly\\nyour superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?”\\n\\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose—\\nIndeed I am not so mad.—But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\\ndistance—and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\\nthe world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\\nproper, in me especially.”\\n\\n“I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\\nwas enough to warm your heart.”\\n\\n“Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!—The very\\nrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time—when I saw him\\ncoming—his noble look—and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one\\nmoment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!”\\n\\n“It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.—Yes,\\nhonourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.—But that it\\nwill be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\\nadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for\\nits being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\\nwisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\\nlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\\nobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\\ngive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\\nthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\\nknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were\\nvery wrong before; we will be cautious now.—He is your superior, no\\ndoubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious\\nnature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there\\nhave been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I\\nwould not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured\\nyour raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I\\nshall always know how to value.”\\n\\nHarriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\\nvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her\\nfriend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must\\nbe saving her from the danger of degradation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\\nHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\\nEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\\nto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\\ngrandmother’s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was\\nagain delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was\\nlikely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she\\nwere able to defeat Mrs. Elton’s activity in her service, and save\\nherself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her\\nwill.\\n\\nMr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had\\ncertainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing\\nto dislike him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in\\nhis pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.\\nEvery thing declared it; his own attentions, his father’s hints, his\\nmother-in-law’s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct,\\ndiscretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many\\nwere devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet,\\nMr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with\\nJane Fairfax. He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of\\nintelligence between them—he thought so at least—symptoms of admiration\\non his side, which, having once observed, he could not persuade himself\\nto think entirely void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any\\nof Emma’s errors of imagination. _She_ was not present when the\\nsuspicion first arose. He was dining with the Randalls family, and\\nJane, at the Eltons’; and he had seen a look, more than a single look,\\nat Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed\\nsomewhat out of place. When he was again in their company, he could not\\nhelp remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations\\nwhich, unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,\\n\\n“Myself creating what I saw,”\\n\\n\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of\\nprivate liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill\\nand Jane.\\n\\nHe had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\\nhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he\\njoined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who,\\nlike themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\\nweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\\nand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\\nreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\\nvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\\nand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately;\\nand after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons\\nlistened to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse’s\\nmost obliging invitation.\\n\\nAs they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on\\nhorseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse.\\n\\n“By the bye,” said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, “what\\nbecame of Mr. Perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, “I did not know that he ever\\nhad any such plan.”\\n\\n“Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.”\\n\\n“Me! impossible!”\\n\\n“Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was\\ncertainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\\nextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\\nthought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\\nmust remember it now?”\\n\\n“Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.”\\n\\n“Never! really, never!—Bless me! how could it be?—Then I must have\\ndreamt it—but I was completely persuaded—Miss Smith, you walk as if you\\nwere tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”\\n\\n“What is this?—What is this?” cried Mr. Weston, “about Perry and a\\ncarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he\\ncan afford it. You had it from himself, had you?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “I seem to have had it from\\nnobody.—Very odd!—I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston’s having\\nmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with\\nall these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\\nit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I\\ndream of every body at Highbury when I am away—and when I have gone\\nthrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\\nPerry.”\\n\\n“It is odd though,” observed his father, “that you should have had such\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\nshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry’s setting up his carriage! and\\nhis wife’s persuading him to it, out of care for his health—just what\\nwill happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\\npremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\\nAnd at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your\\ndream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are\\nabsent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?”\\n\\nEmma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\\nprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of\\nMr. Weston’s hint.\\n\\n“Why, to own the truth,” cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\\nto be heard the last two minutes, “if I must speak on this subject,\\nthere is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have—I do not mean\\nto say that he did not dream it—I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\\ndreams in the world—but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\\nthat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\\nmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\\nourselves—but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\\nthought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\\nhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\\nbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don’t you remember\\ngrandmama’s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had\\nbeen walking to—very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\\nRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother—indeed I\\ndo not know who is not—and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\\nshe had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\\nbeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\\nI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\\nnever dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing\\nbefore I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and\\nnow and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not\\nlike Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the\\nleast thing in the world. Where is she?—Oh! just behind. Perfectly\\nremember Mrs. Perry’s coming.—Extraordinary dream, indeed!”\\n\\nThey were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley’s eyes had preceded Miss\\nBates’s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill’s face, where he\\nthought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\\ninvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\\nwith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen\\nwaited at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\\nChurchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her\\nintently—in vain, however, if it were so—Jane passed between them into\\nthe hall, and looked at neither.\\n\\nThere was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\\nborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round\\nthe large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,\\nand which none but Emma could have had power to place there and\\npersuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on\\nwhich two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea\\npassed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\\n\\n“Miss Woodhouse,” said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\\nhim, which he could reach as he sat, “have your nephews taken away\\ntheir alphabets—their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is\\nit? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated\\nrather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters\\none morning. I want to puzzle you again.”\\n\\nEmma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was\\nquickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\\nfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The\\nquietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,\\nwho had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr.\\nWeston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in\\nlamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor\\nlittle boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter\\nnear him, how beautifully Emma had written it.\\n\\nFrank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\\nglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\\nEmma, Jane opposite to them—and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\\nall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\\napparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\\npushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\\nburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\\nlooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\\nevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell\\nto work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.\\nThe word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there\\nwas a blush on Jane’s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise\\nostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could\\nall be, was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion\\nof his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must\\nbe some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed\\nto meet him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for\\ngallantry and trick. It was a child’s play, chosen to conceal a deeper\\ngame on Frank Churchill’s part.\\n\\nWith great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\\nand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a\\nshort word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and\\ndemure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly\\nentertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to\\nappear to censure; for she said, “Nonsense! for shame!” He heard Frank\\nChurchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, “I will give it to\\nher—shall I?”—and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing\\nwarmth. “No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed.”\\n\\nIt was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\\nfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\\nover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\\ncivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley’s excessive curiosity\\nto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\\nfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it to\\nbe _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax’s perception seemed to accompany his; her\\ncomprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the\\nsuperior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\\nevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\\nmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, “I did not\\nknow that proper names were allowed,” pushed away the letters with even\\nan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\\nthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\\nattack, and turned towards her aunt.\\n\\n“Aye, very true, my dear,” cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\\na word—“I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\\ngoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\\nfor us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\\nnight.”\\n\\nJane’s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\\npreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table;\\nbut so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr.\\nKnightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed\\ntowards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was\\nafterwards looking for her shawl—Frank Churchill was looking also—it\\nwas growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted,\\nMr. Knightley could not tell.\\n\\nHe remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of what\\nhe had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\\nobservations, he must—yes, he certainly must, as a friend—an anxious\\nfriend—give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\\nin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\\nhis duty.\\n\\n“Pray, Emma,” said he, “may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\\npoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw\\nthe word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining\\nto the one, and so very distressing to the other.”\\n\\nEmma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\\nexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she\\nwas really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\\n\\n“Oh!” she cried in evident embarrassment, “it all meant nothing; a mere\\njoke among ourselves.”\\n\\n“The joke,” he replied gravely, “seemed confined to you and Mr.\\nChurchill.”\\n\\nHe had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\\nbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\\ndoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference—fruitless\\ninterference. Emma’s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed\\nto declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to\\nher, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome\\ninterference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather\\nthan the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\\n\\n“My dear Emma,” said he at last, with earnest kindness, “do you think\\nyou perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\\ngentleman and lady we have been speaking of?”\\n\\n“Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.—Why\\ndo you make a doubt of it?”\\n\\n“Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\\nthat she admired him?”\\n\\n“Never, never!” she cried with a most open eagerness—“Never, for the\\ntwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\\nit possibly come into your head?”\\n\\n“I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\\nthem—certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\\npublic.”\\n\\n“Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\\nvouchsafe to let your imagination wander—but it will not do—very sorry\\nto check you in your first essay—but indeed it will not do. There is no\\nadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\\nhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances—feelings\\nrather of a totally different nature—it is impossible exactly to\\nexplain:—there is a good deal of nonsense in it—but the part which is\\ncapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\\nfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\\nthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\\ncan _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman’s\\nindifference.”\\n\\nShe spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which\\nsilenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\\nprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\\nsuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\\ncircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\\nhers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\\nirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\\nfever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse’s tender habits required almost\\nevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\\nleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\\nSuckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\\nimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\\npresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again\\nrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings’\\ncoming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,\\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the\\nsituation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might\\neventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of\\nall her neighbours was by the approach of it.\\n\\nMrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\\nof pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\\nwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\\nat first;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\\nneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the\\nSucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\\nautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\\nto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\\nidea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see\\nwhat every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had\\nagreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more\\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be\\ndone in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the\\nbustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic\\nparade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.\\n\\nThis was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\\nfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr.\\nWeston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and\\nsister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go\\ntogether; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it\\nwas to be, if she had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing\\nbut her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must\\nalready be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:—it\\ncould not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain\\nto his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an\\narrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an\\narrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of\\nbeing said to be of Mrs. Elton’s party! Every feeling was offended; and\\nthe forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of\\nsecret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr.\\nWeston’s temper.\\n\\n“I am glad you approve of what I have done,” said he very comfortably.\\n“But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\\nnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\\nown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\\nleave her out.”\\n\\nEmma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\\n\\nIt was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was\\ngrowing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\\npigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\\ninto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\\nbefore the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\\non, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton’s resources were\\ninadequate to such an attack.\\n\\n“Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?” she cried.—“And such weather\\nfor exploring!—These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\\nare we to do?—The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.\\nBefore this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\\nexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.”\\n\\n“You had better explore to Donwell,” replied Mr. Knightley. “That may\\nbe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are\\nripening fast.”\\n\\nIf Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\\nfor his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “Oh! I should like\\nit of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\\nfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\\nbut no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\\nthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\\nand again to come—much oftener than he doubted—and was extremely\\ngratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\\nas she chose to consider it.\\n\\n“You may depend upon me,” said she. “I certainly will come. Name your\\nday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?”\\n\\n“I cannot name a day,” said he, “till I have spoken to some others whom\\nI would wish to meet you.”\\n\\n“Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.—I am Lady\\nPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.”\\n\\n“I hope you will bring Elton,” said he: “but I will not trouble you to\\ngive any other invitations.”\\n\\n“Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider—you need not be afraid\\nof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\\nMarried women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party.\\nLeave it all to me. I will invite your guests.”\\n\\n“No,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world\\nwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\\nthat one is—”\\n\\n“—Mrs. Weston, I suppose,” interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\\n\\n“No—Mrs. Knightley;—and till she is in being, I will manage such\\nmatters myself.”\\n\\n“Ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one\\npreferred to herself.—“You are a humourist, and may say what you like.\\nQuite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me—Jane and her\\naunt.—The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\\nthe Hartfield family. Don’t scruple. I know you are attached to them.”\\n\\n“You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on\\nMiss Bates in my way home.”\\n\\n“That’s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:—but as you like. It is\\nto be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\\nshall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\\non my arm. Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\\nmore simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\\nno form or parade—a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your\\ngardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\\ntrees;—and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\\nof doors—a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\\nand simple as possible. Is not that your idea?”\\n\\n“Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the\\ntable spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\\ngentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\\nbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\\nstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.”\\n\\n“Well—as you please; only don’t have a great set out. And, by the bye,\\ncan I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?—Pray be\\nsincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to\\ninspect anything—”\\n\\n“I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.”\\n\\n“Well—but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\\nclever.”\\n\\n“I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\\nwould spurn any body’s assistance.”\\n\\n“I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\\ndonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me—and my caro sposo walking by. I\\nreally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I\\nconceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so\\nmany resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\\nhome;—and very long walks, you know—in summer there is dust, and in\\nwinter there is dirt.”\\n\\n“You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane\\nis never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however,\\nif you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole’s. I would wish every thing\\nto be as much to your taste as possible.”\\n\\n“That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\\nUnder that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\\nwarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.—Yes,\\nbelieve me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\\nthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\\nme.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\\nwished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat\\nwould inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\\nspecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\\nDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.\\n\\nHe was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him\\nfor his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for\\ntwo years. “Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\\nvery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear\\ngirls walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp\\nnow, in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house\\nagain exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton,\\nand any other of his neighbours.—He could not see any objection at all\\nto his, and Emma’s, and Harriet’s going there some very fine morning.\\nHe thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them—very kind\\nand sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—He was not fond of dining\\nout.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley was fortunate in every body’s most ready concurrence. The\\ninvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\\nMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\\nto themselves.—Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\\npleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over\\nto join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which\\ncould have been dispensed with.—Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say\\nthat he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no\\ntime in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\\nBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\\nsettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,—the weather appearing\\nexactly right.\\n\\nUnder a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\\nsafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\\nthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\\nAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\\nhappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\\nhad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\\nto heat themselves.—Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\\npurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all\\nthe others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\\nsympathiser.\\n\\nIt was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\\nwas satisfied of her father’s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and\\nlook around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more\\nparticular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds\\nwhich must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\\n\\nShe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\\nthe present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\\nthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\\ncharacteristic situation, low and sheltered—its ample gardens\\nstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\\nall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight—and its abundance\\nof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\\nhad rooted up.—The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\\nit, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\\ncomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.—It was just what it ought\\nto be, and it looked what it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\\nin blood and understanding.—Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\\nbut Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\\nneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These\\nwere pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\\nwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\\nstrawberry-beds.—The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\\nChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\\nin all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was\\nvery ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\\ntalking—strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\\nspoken of.—“The best fruit in England—every body’s favourite—always\\nwholesome.—These the finest beds and finest sorts.—Delightful to gather\\nfor one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them.—Morning decidedly\\nthe best time—never tired—every sort good—hautboy infinitely\\nsuperior—no comparison—the others hardly eatable—hautboys very\\nscarce—Chili preferred—white wood finest flavour of all—price of\\nstrawberries in London—abundance about Bristol—Maple\\nGrove—cultivation—beds when to be renewed—gardeners thinking exactly\\ndifferent—no general rule—gardeners never to be put out of their\\nway—delicious fruit—only too rich to be eaten much of—inferior to\\ncherries—currants more refreshing—only objection to gathering\\nstrawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no\\nlonger—must go and sit in the shade.”\\n\\nSuch, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only once by\\nMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\\ninquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—She had some fears\\nof his horse.\\n\\nSeats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to\\noverhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.—A situation,\\na most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received\\nnotice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs.\\nSuckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it\\nfell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an\\nacquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful,\\ncharming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every\\nthing—and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\\nimmediately.—On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph—and she\\npositively refused to take her friend’s negative, though Miss Fairfax\\ncontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\\nthing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\\nbefore.—Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\\nacquiescence by the morrow’s post.—How Jane could bear it at all, was\\nastonishing to Emma.—She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly—and at\\nlast, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\\nremoval.—“Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\\ngardens—all the gardens?—She wished to see the whole extent.”—The\\npertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\\n\\nIt was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a\\nscattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of\\nlimes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the\\nriver, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.—It led to nothing;\\nnothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,\\nwhich seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an\\napproach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however,\\nas might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a\\ncharming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.—The\\nconsiderable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,\\ngradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a\\nmile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well\\nclothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed\\nand sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the\\nriver making a close and handsome curve around it.\\n\\nIt was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\\nEnglish culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without\\nbeing oppressive.\\n\\nIn this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\\ntowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\\ndistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\\nHarriet!—It was an odd tête-à-tête; but she was glad to see it.—There\\nhad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\\nturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\\nconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been\\nsorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;\\nbut now she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its\\nappendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading\\nflocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.—She\\njoined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in\\nlooking around. He was giving Harriet information as to modes of\\nagriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, “These\\nare my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without\\nbeing suspected of introducing Robert Martin.”—She did not suspect him.\\nIt was too old a story.—Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of\\nHarriet.—They took a few turns together along the walk.—The shade was\\nmost refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\\n\\nThe next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they\\nwere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\\nWeston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\\nuneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\\nthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\\ncoming, with more than common certainty. “His aunt was so much better,\\nthat he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”—Mrs. Churchill’s\\nstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\\nsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\\ndependence—and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\\nthat it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented\\ncoming.—Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;\\nshe behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\\n\\nThe cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\\nwhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as\\nfar as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\\nany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.—Mr.\\nWoodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\\nof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by\\nhim, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him,\\nthat Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise\\nand variety which her spirits seemed to need.\\n\\nMr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse’s\\nentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\\nshells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\\nprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the\\nkindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly\\nwell amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he\\nwould shew them all to Emma;—fortunate in having no other resemblance\\nto a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was\\nslow, constant, and methodical.—Before this second looking over was\\nbegun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few\\nmoments’ free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the\\nhouse—and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly\\nin from the garden, and with a look of escape.—Little expecting to meet\\nMiss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse\\nwas the very person she was in quest of.\\n\\n“Will you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say that I am\\ngone home?—I am going this moment.—My aunt is not aware how late it is,\\nnor how long we have been absent—but I am sure we shall be wanted, and\\nI am determined to go directly.—I have said nothing about it to any\\nbody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to\\nthe ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not\\nbe missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I\\nam gone?”\\n\\n“Certainly, if you wish it;—but you are not going to walk to Highbury\\nalone?”\\n\\n“Yes—what should hurt me?—I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\\nminutes.”\\n\\n“But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\\nfather’s servant go with you.—Let me order the carriage. It can be\\nround in five minutes.”\\n\\n“Thank you, thank you—but on no account.—I would rather walk.—And for\\n_me_ to be afraid of walking alone!—I, who may so soon have to guard\\nothers!”\\n\\nShe spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, “That\\ncan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\\ncarriage. The heat even would be danger.—You are fatigued already.”\\n\\n“I am,”—she answered—“I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\\nfatigue—quick walking will refresh me.—Miss Woodhouse, we all know at\\ntimes what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\\nexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me\\nhave my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.”\\n\\nEmma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\\nher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched\\nher safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\\ngrateful—and her parting words, “Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\\nbeing sometimes alone!”—seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\\nto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\\neven towards some of those who loved her best.\\n\\n“Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said Emma, as she turned back into\\nthe hall again. “I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\\ntheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.”\\n\\nJane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\\naccomplished some views of St. Mark’s Place, Venice, when Frank\\nChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\\nforgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\\nwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right who\\nhad named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by a\\ntemporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\\nlasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\\ntill very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how\\nlate, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\\ncome at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\\nlike it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him like\\nheat—he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\\nintolerable—and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\\nslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse’s fire, looking very deplorable.\\n\\n“You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,” said Emma.\\n\\n“As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\\nspared—but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\\ngoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\\ncame—Madness in such weather!—absolute madness!”\\n\\nEmma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill’s\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\\nhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\\nhis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\\nthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking some\\nrefreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\\ndining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door.\\n\\n“No—he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\\nhotter.” In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\\nmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all\\nher attention to her father, saying in secret—\\n\\n“I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\\nwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet’s sweet easy\\ntemper will not mind it.”\\n\\nHe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\\nback all the better—grown quite cool—and, with good manners, like\\nhimself—able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\\nemployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\\nHe was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\\nat last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\\nover views in Swisserland.\\n\\n“As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,” said he. “I shall\\nnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\\nsketches, some time or other, to look at—or my tour to read—or my poem.\\nI shall do something to expose myself.”\\n\\n“That may be—but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\\nSwisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave\\nEngland.”\\n\\n“They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\\nher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\\nassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\\nshall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\\nwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\\neyes may fancy—I am sick of England—and would leave it to-morrow, if I\\ncould.”\\n\\n“You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\\nhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?”\\n\\n“_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\\nnot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in\\nevery thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\\nperson.”\\n\\n“You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\\neat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice\\nof cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you\\nnearly on a par with the rest of us.”\\n\\n“No—I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.”\\n\\n“We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;—you will join us. It is not\\nSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want\\nof a change. You will stay, and go with us?”\\n\\n“No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.”\\n\\n“But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.”\\n\\n“No—It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.”\\n\\n“Then pray stay at Richmond.”\\n\\n“But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of\\nyou all there without me.”\\n\\n“These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\\nown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.”\\n\\nThe rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\\nWith some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\\ntook it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\\ndisturbance on Miss Fairfax’s disappearance being explained. That it\\nwas time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short\\nfinal arrangement for the next day’s scheme, they parted. Frank\\nChurchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much,\\nthat his last words to Emma were,\\n\\n“Well;—if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.”\\n\\nShe smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from\\nRichmond was to take him back before the following evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\\ncircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\\nfavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\\nsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\\ntime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\\nthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\\nWoodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\\nSeven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\\nhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\\nof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of\\nspirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated\\ntoo much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took\\ncharge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank\\nChurchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise\\nbetter. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never\\nmaterially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness\\nto mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole\\nhours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\\nseparation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine\\nprospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to\\nremove.\\n\\nAt first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\\nChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing—looked\\nwithout seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing\\nwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\\nshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\\n\\nWhen they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\\nfor Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first\\nobject. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to\\nher. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he\\ncared for—and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,\\nwas gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the\\nadmission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most\\nanimating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own\\nestimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people\\nlooking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but\\nflirtation could very well describe. “Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\\nWoodhouse flirted together excessively.” They were laying themselves\\nopen to that very phrase—and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple\\nGrove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and\\nthoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less\\nhappy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed;\\nand though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all,\\nwhether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious,\\nthey were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her\\nfriend.\\n\\n“How much I am obliged to you,” said he, “for telling me to come\\nto-day!—If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\\nthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.”\\n\\n“Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that\\nyou were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than\\nyou deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to\\ncome.”\\n\\n“Don’t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.”\\n\\n“It is hotter to-day.”\\n\\n“Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.”\\n\\n“You are comfortable because you are under command.”\\n\\n“Your command?—Yes.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\\nsomehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\\nmanagement; but to-day you are got back again—and as I cannot be always\\nwith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\\nrather than mine.”\\n\\n“It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\\nmotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\\nwith me. You are always with me.”\\n\\n“Dating from three o’clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\\nbegin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour\\nbefore.”\\n\\n“Three o’clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\\nfirst in February.”\\n\\n“Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)—nobody\\nspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\\nnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.”\\n\\n“I say nothing of which I am ashamed,” replied he, with lively\\nimpudence. “I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\\nhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and\\nDorking on the other. I saw you first in February.” And then\\nwhispering—“Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to\\nrouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies and\\ngentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\\npresides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\\nof?”\\n\\nSome laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\\ndeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse’s presiding; Mr.\\nKnightley’s answer was the most distinct.\\n\\n“Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\\nthinking of?”\\n\\n“Oh! no, no”—cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could—“Upon no\\naccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\\nof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all\\nthinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps,\\n(glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be\\nafraid of knowing.”\\n\\n“It is a sort of thing,” cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, “which _I_\\nshould not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\\nperhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party—_I_ never was in any\\ncircle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—”\\n\\nHer mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\\n\\n“Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but\\nsome ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body\\nknows what is due to _you_.”\\n\\n“It will not do,” whispered Frank to Emma; “they are most of them\\naffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen—I\\nam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\\nknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\\nsomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\\nare seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\\nentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\\nthing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated—or two\\nthings moderately clever—or three things very dull indeed, and she\\nengages to laugh heartily at them all.”\\n\\n“Oh! very well,” exclaimed Miss Bates, “then I need not be uneasy.\\n‘Three things very dull indeed.’ That will just do for me, you know. I\\nshall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\\nshan’t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on\\nevery body’s assent)—Do not you all think I shall?”\\n\\nEmma could not resist.\\n\\n“Ah! ma’am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me—but you will be\\nlimited as to number—only three at once.”\\n\\nMiss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\\nimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\\nanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\\n\\n“Ah!—well—to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\\nKnightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\\ndisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old\\nfriend.”\\n\\n“I like your plan,” cried Mr. Weston. “Agreed, agreed. I will do my\\nbest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?”\\n\\n“Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his son;—“but we shall be\\nindulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.”\\n\\n“No, no,” said Emma, “it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\\nWeston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\\nhear it.”\\n\\n“I doubt its being very clever myself,” said Mr. Weston. “It is too\\nmuch a matter of fact, but here it is.—What two letters of the alphabet\\nare there, that express perfection?”\\n\\n“What two letters!—express perfection! I am sure I do not know.”\\n\\n“Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\\nguess.—I will tell you.—M. and A.—Em-ma.—Do you understand?”\\n\\nUnderstanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\\nindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\\nenjoy in it—and so did Frank and Harriet.—It did not seem to touch the\\nrest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\\nKnightley gravely said,\\n\\n“This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\\nhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\\nelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.”\\n\\n“Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,” said Mrs. Elton; “_I_\\nreally cannot attempt—I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\\nan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\\npleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!—You know\\nwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very well\\nat Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\\nplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in\\nsummer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have\\nwitty things at every body’s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I\\nhave a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be\\nallowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if\\nyou please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We\\nhave nothing clever to say—not one of us.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,” added her husband, with a sort of sneering\\nconsciousness; “_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\\nWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man—quite good for\\nnothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?”\\n\\n“With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\\nCome, Jane, take my other arm.”\\n\\nJane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. “Happy\\ncouple!” said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\\nhearing:—“How well they suit one another!—Very lucky—marrying as they\\ndid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!—They only knew\\neach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!—for as to\\nany real knowledge of a person’s disposition that Bath, or any public\\nplace, can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\\nonly by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\\nthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\\nis all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\\nhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\\nof his life!”\\n\\nMiss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\\nconfederates, spoke now.\\n\\n“Such things do occur, undoubtedly.”—She was stopped by a cough. Frank\\nChurchill turned towards her to listen.\\n\\n“You were speaking,” said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\\n\\n“I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate\\ncircumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot\\nimagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may\\narise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I\\nwould be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute\\ncharacters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)\\nwho will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an\\noppression for ever.”\\n\\nHe made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\\nafterwards said, in a lively tone,\\n\\n“Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\\nmarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning\\nto Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?—I am sure I should like any\\nbody fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a\\nsmile at his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt\\nher, educate her.”\\n\\n“And make her like myself.”\\n\\n“By all means, if you can.”\\n\\n“Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming\\nwife.”\\n\\n“She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\\nI shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return, I shall come\\nto you for my wife. Remember.”\\n\\nEmma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\\nfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\\nHazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\\nHe might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could\\nsay? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\\n\\n“Now, ma’am,” said Jane to her aunt, “shall we join Mrs. Elton?”\\n\\n“If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\\nready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\\nsoon overtake her. There she is—no, that’s somebody else. That’s one of\\nthe ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.—Well, I\\ndeclare—”\\n\\nThey walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr.\\nWeston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man’s\\nspirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at\\nlast of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking\\nquietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and\\nquite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views\\nbeneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them to\\ngive notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of\\ncollecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to\\nhave _her_ carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the\\nquiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of\\nthis day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many\\nill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.\\n\\nWhile waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\\nlooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\\n\\n“Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\\nprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use\\nit. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could\\nyou be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your\\nwit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?—Emma, I had not\\nthought it possible.”\\n\\nEmma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\\n\\n“Nay, how could I help saying what I did?—Nobody could have helped it.\\nIt was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.”\\n\\n“I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of it\\nsince. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what\\ncandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\\nforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\\never receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\\nso irksome.”\\n\\n“Oh!” cried Emma, “I know there is not a better creature in the world:\\nbut you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\\nunfortunately blended in her.”\\n\\n“They are blended,” said he, “I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\\nI could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\\nthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\\nabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\\nliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation—but, Emma,\\nconsider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\\nfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\\nprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\\nbadly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she\\nhad seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have\\nyou now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at\\nher, humble her—and before her niece, too—and before others, many of\\nwhom (certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\\nof her.—This is not pleasant to you, Emma—and it is very far from\\npleasant to me; but I must, I will,—I will tell you truths while I can;\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\\ntrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than\\nyou can do now.”\\n\\nWhile they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\\nready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\\nmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\\ntongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\\nmortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and,\\non entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome—then\\nreproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no\\nacknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with\\nvoice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He\\nhad turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look\\nback, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they\\nwere half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was\\nvexed beyond what could have been expressed—almost beyond what she\\ncould conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at\\nany circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth\\nof this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart.\\nHow could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could\\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And\\nhow suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of\\nconcurrence, of common kindness!\\n\\nTime did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\\nit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\\nto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\\nfagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\\ndown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble\\nto check them, extraordinary as they were.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\nThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma’s thoughts all the\\nevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\\nnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\\nmight be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a\\nmorning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\\nsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\\nany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her\\nfather, was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for\\nthere she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his\\ncomfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond\\naffection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct,\\nbe open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not\\nwithout a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, “How could\\nyou be so unfeeling to your father?—I must, I will tell you truths\\nwhile I can.” Miss Bates should never again—no, never! If attention, in\\nfuture, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had\\nbeen often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in\\nthought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.\\nIn the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next\\nmorning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular,\\nequal, kindly intercourse.\\n\\nShe was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\\nnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\\nmight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while\\nshe were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\\nashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\\nHer eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\\n\\n“The ladies were all at home.” She had never rejoiced at the sound\\nbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\\nderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\\n\\nThere was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\\nShe heard Miss Bates’s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\\nmaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait\\na moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed\\nboth escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse\\nof, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she\\nheard Miss Bates saying, “Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid\\ndown upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.”\\n\\nPoor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did\\nnot quite understand what was going on.\\n\\n“I am afraid Jane is not very well,” said she, “but I do not know; they\\n_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\\nMiss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I\\nam very little able—Have you a chair, ma’am? Do you sit where you like?\\nI am sure she will be here presently.”\\n\\nEmma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment’s fear of Miss Bates\\nkeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came—“Very happy and\\nobliged”—but Emma’s conscience told her that there was not the same\\ncheerful volubility as before—less ease of look and manner. A very\\nfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\\nreturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\\n\\n“Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—and are\\ncome to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\\nme—(twinkling away a tear or two)—but it will be very trying for us to\\npart with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\\nheadache just now, writing all the morning:—such long letters, you\\nknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. ‘My dear,’\\nsaid I, ‘you will blind yourself’—for tears were in her eyes\\nperpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great\\nchange; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation, I\\nsuppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do\\nnot think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good\\nfortune—(again dispersing her tears)—but, poor dear soul! if you were\\nto see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one\\ncannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as\\npossible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy\\nshe is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming\\nto you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie\\ndown upon the bed. ‘My dear,’ said I, ‘I shall say you are laid down\\nupon the bed:’ but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room.\\nBut, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be\\nwell. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\\nbut your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door—I\\nwas quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so\\nhappened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the\\nstairs, we did not know any body was coming. ‘It is only Mrs. Cole,’\\nsaid I, ‘depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.’ ‘Well,’ said\\nshe, ‘it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.’\\nBut then Patty came in, and said it was you. ‘Oh!’ said I, ‘it is Miss\\nWoodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.’—‘I can see nobody,’\\nsaid she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us\\nkeep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. ‘If you must\\ngo, my dear,’ said I, ‘you must, and I will say you are laid down upon\\nthe bed.’”\\n\\nEmma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\\nkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing\\nbut pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\\nsensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very\\nnaturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when\\nshe might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest\\nregret and solicitude—sincerely wishing that the circumstances which\\nshe collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might\\nbe as much for Miss Fairfax’s advantage and comfort as possible. “It\\nmust be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be\\ndelayed till Colonel Campbell’s return.”\\n\\n“So very kind!” replied Miss Bates. “But you are always kind.”\\n\\nThere was no bearing such an “always;” and to break through her\\ndreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of—\\n\\n“Where—may I ask?—is Miss Fairfax going?”\\n\\n“To a Mrs. Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge\\nof her three little girls—delightful children. Impossible that any\\nsituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\\nMrs. Suckling’s own family, and Mrs. Bragge’s; but Mrs. Smallridge is\\nintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four\\nmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes—”\\n\\n“Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\\nwould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, ‘No;’ for when\\nJane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very\\nmorning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite\\ndecided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention;\\nexactly as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till\\nColonel Campbell’s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into\\nany engagement at present—and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\\nagain—and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\\nmind!—but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\\nfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\\nsuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane’s answer; but she\\npositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\\nJane wished her; she would wait—and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\\nwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\\nthe least idea!—Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\\nupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge’s situation, she\\nhad come to the resolution of accepting it.—I did not know a word of it\\ntill it was all settled.”\\n\\n“You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?”\\n\\n“Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\\nthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. ‘You _must_\\n_all_ spend your evening with us,’ said she—‘I positively must have you\\n_all_ come.’”\\n\\n“Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?”\\n\\n“No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\\nthought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let\\nhim off, he did not;—but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,\\nand a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\\nWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\\nrather fagged after the morning’s party. Even pleasure, you know, is\\nfatiguing—and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\\nenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\\nand feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.”\\n\\n“Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\\nmaking up her mind the whole day?”\\n\\n“I dare say she had.”\\n\\n“Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\\nfriends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\\npossible—I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.”\\n\\n“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in\\nthe world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\\nBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\\nand elegant, in all Mrs. Elton’s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\\ndelightful woman!—A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as\\nto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\\nare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\\nsuch regard and kindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\\npleasure.—And her salary!—I really cannot venture to name her salary to\\nyou, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\\nhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like\\nJane.”\\n\\n“Ah! madam,” cried Emma, “if other children are at all like what I\\nremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\\nwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\\nearned.”\\n\\n“You are so noble in your ideas!”\\n\\n“And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?”\\n\\n“Very soon, very soon, indeed; that’s the worst of it. Within a\\nfortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not\\nknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\\nsay, Come ma’am, do not let us think about it any more.”\\n\\n“Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\\nMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before\\ntheir return?”\\n\\n“Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a\\nsituation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so\\nastonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs.\\nElton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me\\nupon it! It was before tea—stay—no, it could not be before tea, because\\nwe were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea, because I\\nremember thinking—Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something\\nhappened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room\\nbefore tea, old John Abdy’s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old\\nJohn, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father\\ntwenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very\\npoorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must go and see him\\nto-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor\\nJohn’s son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he\\nis very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown,\\nostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his\\nfather without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us\\nwhat John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the\\nchaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to\\nRichmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane\\nspoke to Mrs. Elton.”\\n\\nMiss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\\ncircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\\ncould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill’s\\ngoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\\naccumulation of the ostler’s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\\nservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\\nsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill—which messenger,\\nhowever, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\\nsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\\naccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\\nback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\\nresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\\nseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\\nCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\\ngoing a good pace, and driving very steady.\\n\\nThere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\\ncaught Emma’s attention only as it united with the subject which\\nalready engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill’s\\nimportance in the world, and Jane Fairfax’s, struck her; one was every\\nthing, the other nothing—and she sat musing on the difference of\\nwoman’s destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,\\ntill roused by Miss Bates’s saying,\\n\\n“Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\\nof that?—Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.—‘You\\nmust go,’ said she. ‘You and I must part. You will have no business\\nhere.—Let it stay, however,’ said she; ‘give it houseroom till Colonel\\nCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\\nme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.’—And to this day, I do\\nbelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter’s.”\\n\\nNow Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\\nall her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long\\nenough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to\\nsay of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nEmma’s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\\nbut on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\\nKnightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\\nwith her father.—Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\\ndecidedly graver than usual, said,\\n\\n“I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\\nand therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\\na few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\\nbesides the ‘love,’ which nobody carries?”\\n\\n“Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?”\\n\\n“Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time.”\\n\\nEmma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\\nhowever, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\\nagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going—her father\\nbegan his inquiries.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?—And how did you find my\\nworthy old friend and her daughter?—I dare say they must have been very\\nmuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and\\nMiss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\\nattentive to them!”\\n\\nEmma’s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,\\nand shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\\nKnightley.—It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\\nher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\\nhad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.—\\nHe looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified—and in\\nanother moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\\nfriendliness on his part.—He took her hand;—whether she had not herself\\nmade the first motion, she could not say—she might, perhaps, have\\nrather offered it—but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was\\non the point of carrying it to his lips—when, from some fancy or other,\\nhe suddenly let it go.—Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should\\nchange his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive.—He\\nwould have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped.—The\\nintention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his\\nmanners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\\nhappened, but she thought nothing became him more.—It was with him, of\\nso simple, yet so dignified a nature.—She could not but recall the\\nattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.—He left\\nthem immediately afterwards—gone in a moment. He always moved with the\\nalertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\\nnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\\n\\nEmma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\\nhad left her ten minutes earlier;—it would have been a great pleasure\\nto talk over Jane Fairfax’s situation with Mr. Knightley.—Neither would\\nshe regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew\\nhow much his visit would be enjoyed—but it might have happened at a\\nbetter time—and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\\npleasanter.—They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be\\ndeceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\\ngallantry;—it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\\nhis good opinion.—He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\\nfound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\\n\\nIn the hope of diverting her father’s thoughts from the\\ndisagreeableness of Mr. Knightley’s going to London; and going so\\nsuddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;\\nEmma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the\\neffect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,—interested,\\nwithout disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax’s\\ngoing out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr.\\nKnightley’s going to London had been an unexpected blow.\\n\\n“I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\\nsettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\\nher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\\nsituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\\nbe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor’s always was with me.\\nYou know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\\nwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\\ninduced to go away after it has been her home so long.”\\n\\nThe following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\\ninto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\\ndeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\\nto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\\nhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\\nthing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\\nstruggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\\n\\nIt was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\\ngravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\\nsurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\\nshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\\nto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\\ndisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\\nMrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\\nnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\\njustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\\nevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\\nimaginary complaints.\\n\\n“Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\\nmore than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the\\ntemper. It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what\\nwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill’s loss would be\\ndreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.”—Even Mr.\\nWeston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “Ah! poor woman,\\nwho would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be\\nas handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over\\nher broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.\\nHow it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It\\nwas also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs.\\nChurchill, the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both\\nwith awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how\\nFrank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw\\nin a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith\\nwould have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his\\nwife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into\\nany thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the\\nnephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the\\ncause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.\\n\\nHarriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great\\nself-command. What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed\\nnothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of\\nstrengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might\\nendanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill’s\\ndeath with mutual forbearance.\\n\\nShort letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\\nthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\\nwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\\ndeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a\\nvery old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\\nvisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\\nHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\\non Emma’s side.\\n\\nIt was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\\nprospects were closing, while Harriet’s opened, and whose engagements\\nnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\\nkindness—and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\\na stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\\nhad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\\nwould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\\nto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and\\ntestify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to\\nspend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation\\nwas refused, and by a verbal message. “Miss Fairfax was not well enough\\nto write;” and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it\\nappeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,\\nthough against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering\\nunder severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him\\ndoubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge’s at the time\\nproposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged—appetite\\nquite gone—and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms,\\nnothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing\\napprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought\\nshe had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so\\nherself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\\npresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\\ndisorder:—confined always to one room;—he could have wished it\\notherwise—and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\\nacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\\ndescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\\nin fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\\nmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\\ngrieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\\nway of being useful. To take her—be it only an hour or two—from her\\naunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\\nconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\\nfollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\\nshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\\nhour that Jane would name—mentioning that she had Mr. Perry’s decided\\nopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was\\nonly in this short note:\\n\\n“Miss Fairfax’s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\\nexercise.”\\n\\nEmma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\\nimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\\nindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\\ncounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\\nanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates’s,\\nin the hope that Jane would be induced to join her—but it would not\\ndo;—Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\\nwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\\nservice—and every thing that message could do was tried—but all in\\nvain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite\\nunpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\\nworse.—Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\\nbut, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\\nthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\\n“Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\\nbody—any body at all—Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied—and Mrs.\\nCole had made such a point—and Mrs. Perry had said so much—but, except\\nthem, Jane would really see nobody.”\\n\\nEmma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\\nand the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\\nshe feel any right of preference herself—she submitted, therefore, and\\nonly questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece’s appetite and diet,\\nwhich she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\\nwas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\\nthing:—Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they\\ncould command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\\ndistasteful.\\n\\nEmma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\\nexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\nwas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In\\nhalf an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from\\nMiss Bates, but “dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being\\nsent back; it was a thing she could not take—and, moreover, she\\ninsisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.”\\n\\nWhen Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\\nabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\\nthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\\nexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\\nshe could have no doubt—putting every thing together—that Jane was\\nresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\\nHer heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\\nfrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\\ninequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\\ncredit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend:\\nbut she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good,\\nand of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been\\nprivy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have\\nseen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any\\nthing to reprove.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill’s decease, Emma was\\ncalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and\\nwanted particularly to speak with her.”—He met her at the parlour-door,\\nand hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice,\\nsunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\\n\\n“Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?—Do, if it be\\npossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.”\\n\\n“Is she unwell?”\\n\\n“No, no, not at all—only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\\ncarriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\\nknow—(nodding towards her father)—Humph!—Can you come?”\\n\\n“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\\nyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?—Is she really not\\nill?”\\n\\n“Depend upon me—but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\\ntime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!”\\n\\nTo guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\\nreally important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\\nwell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her\\nfather, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon\\nout of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for\\nRandalls.\\n\\n“Now,”—said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now\\nMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.”\\n\\n“No, no,”—he gravely replied.—“Don’t ask me. I promised my wife to\\nleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\\nbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.”\\n\\n“Break it to me,” cried Emma, standing still with terror.—“Good\\nGod!—Mr. Weston, tell me at once.—Something has happened in Brunswick\\nSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what\\nit is.”\\n\\n“No, indeed you are mistaken.”—\\n\\n“Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.—Consider how many of my dearest\\nfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?—I charge you\\nby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”\\n\\n“Upon my word, Emma.”—\\n\\n“Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour, that it\\nhas nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!—What can be to be\\n_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”\\n\\n“Upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. It is not in\\nthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\\nKnightley.”\\n\\nEmma’s courage returned, and she walked on.\\n\\n“I was wrong,” he continued, “in talking of its being _broke_ to you. I\\nshould not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\\nyou—it concerns only myself,—that is, we hope.—Humph!—In short, my dear\\nEmma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don’t say that\\nit is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse.—If we\\nwalk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.”\\n\\nEmma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\\nasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\\nthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\\nconcern—something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\\ncircumstances of the family,—something which the late event at Richmond\\nhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\\nchildren, perhaps—and poor Frank cut off!—This, though very\\nundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little\\nmore than an animating curiosity.\\n\\n“Who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they\\nproceeded—speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\\nthan with any other view.\\n\\n“I do not know.—One of the Otways.—Not Frank;—it is not Frank, I assure\\nyou. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time.”\\n\\n“Has your son been with you, then?”\\n\\n“Oh! yes—did not you know?—Well, well, never mind.”\\n\\nFor a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\\nand demure,\\n\\n“Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”\\n\\nThey hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.—“Well, my dear,” said\\nhe, as they entered the room—“I have brought her, and now I hope you\\nwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\\ndelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.”—And Emma distinctly\\nheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,—“I have\\nbeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\\nthat Emma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\\neagerly said,\\n\\n“What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\\nfind, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. I have been\\nwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do\\nnot let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\\ndistress, whatever it may be.”\\n\\n“Have you indeed no idea?” said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\\n“Cannot you, my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\\nhear?”\\n\\n“So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.”\\n\\n“You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;”\\n(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “He has\\nbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\\nimpossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\\nsubject,—to announce an attachment—”\\n\\nShe stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\\nHarriet.\\n\\n“More than an attachment, indeed,” resumed Mrs. Weston; “an\\nengagement—a positive engagement.—What will you say, Emma—what will any\\nbody say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\\nengaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”\\n\\nEmma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\\n\\n“Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?”\\n\\n“You may well be amazed,” returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her\\neyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to\\nrecover— “You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a\\nsolemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth,\\nand kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\\nthemselves—neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.—It is so\\nwonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet\\nalmost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.—I thought I knew\\nhim.”\\n\\nEmma scarcely heard what was said.—Her mind was divided between two\\nideas—her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\\npoor Harriet;—and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\\nconfirmation, repeated confirmation.\\n\\n“Well,” said she at last, trying to recover herself; “this is a\\ncircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\\nall comprehend it. What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of\\nthem came to Highbury?”\\n\\n“Engaged since October,—secretly engaged.—It has hurt me, Emma, very\\nmuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\\ncannot excuse.”\\n\\nEmma pondered a moment, and then replied, “I will not pretend _not_ to\\nunderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\\nthat no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\\napprehensive of.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma’s countenance was as\\nsteady as her words.\\n\\n“That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\\npresent perfect indifference,” she continued, “I will farther tell you,\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\\ndid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay,\\nwas attached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\\nFortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\\nfor at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\\nbelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\\nutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\\nthan any thing else in the world could do.\\n\\n“Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “On\\nthis point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\\nmight be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.—\\nImagine what we have been feeling on your account.”\\n\\n“I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\\nwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\\nand I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to\\ncome among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so\\n_very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he\\ncertainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\\nattention, as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another?—How\\ncould he tell what mischief he might be doing?—How could he tell that\\nhe might not be making me in love with him?—very wrong, very wrong\\nindeed.”\\n\\n“From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine—”\\n\\n“And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to\\nlook on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\\nbefore her face, and not resent it.—That is a degree of placidity,\\nwhich I can neither comprehend nor respect.”\\n\\n“There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\\nHe had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\\nquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the\\nfull use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been\\nmisunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed\\nto be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\\npossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”\\n\\n“Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston—it is too calm a censure. Much, much\\nbeyond impropriety!—It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\\nin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright\\nintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain\\nof trick and littleness, which a man should display in every\\ntransaction of his life.”\\n\\n“Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\\nin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\\nmany, very many, good qualities; and—”\\n\\n“Good God!” cried Emma, not attending to her.—“Mrs. Smallridge, too!\\nJane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\\nsuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her\\neven to think of such a measure!”\\n\\n“He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\\nhim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him—or at\\nleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.—Till yesterday, I\\nknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I\\ndo not know how, but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery\\nof what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined\\nhim to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\\nhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\\nconcealment that had been carrying on so long.”\\n\\nEmma began to listen better.\\n\\n“I am to hear from him soon,” continued Mrs. Weston. “He told me at\\nparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\\nus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\\nmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be\\nunderstood. Don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to\\ncondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\\nsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\\nfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\\nboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\\nconcealment.”\\n\\n“_His_ sufferings,” replied Emma dryly, “do not appear to have done him\\nmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?”\\n\\n“Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a\\ndifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that\\nfamily! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have\\nbeen a hope, a chance, a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at\\nrest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly\\nopposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when\\nundue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with\\nvery little persuasion.”\\n\\n“Ah!” thought Emma, “he would have done as much for Harriet.”\\n\\n“This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\\nmorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates’s, I fancy, some time—and\\nthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\\nto whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\\nhe could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.—He was very much\\nagitated—very much, indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a\\ndifferent creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.—In\\naddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\\nvery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of—and there was\\nevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.”\\n\\n“And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with\\nsuch perfect secresy?—The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know\\nof the engagement?”\\n\\nEmma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\\n\\n“None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being\\nin the world but their two selves.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Emma, “I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\\nidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very\\nabominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\\nhypocrisy and deceit,—espionage, and treachery?—To come among us with\\nprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to\\njudge us all!—Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\\ncompletely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\\nand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\\ncarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\\nwords that were never meant for both to hear.—They must take the\\nconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\\nperfectly agreeable!”\\n\\n“I am quite easy on that head,” replied Mrs. Weston. “I am very sure\\nthat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might\\nnot have heard.”\\n\\n“You are in luck.—Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\\nimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”\\n\\n“True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\\nFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\\nas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.”\\n\\nAt this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the\\nwindow, evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited\\nhim in; and, while he was coming round, added, “Now, dearest Emma, let\\nme intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at\\nease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the\\nbest of it—and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her\\nfavour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not\\nfeel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance\\nfor him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a\\ngirl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always\\ngiven her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for, in\\nspite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And\\nhow much may be said in her situation for even that error!”\\n\\n“Much, indeed!” cried Emma feelingly. “If a woman can ever be excused\\nfor thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\\nFairfax’s.—Of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is not their’s,\\nnor the world’s law.’”\\n\\nShe met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\\nexclaiming,\\n\\n“A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\\ndevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent\\nof guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\\nyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\\ncondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—I congratulate\\nyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of\\nthe most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your\\ndaughter.”\\n\\nA glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\\nright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\\nwas immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he\\nshook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the\\nsubject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and\\npersuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companions\\nsuggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;\\nand by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked\\nit all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was\\nbecome perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best\\nthing that Frank could possibly have done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\n“Harriet, poor Harriet!”—Those were the words; in them lay the\\ntormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\\nthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved\\nvery ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much _his_\\nbehaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\\nscrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet’s account, that gave the\\ndeepest hue to his offence.—Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe\\nof her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\\nprophetically, when he once said, “Emma, you have been no friend to\\nHarriet Smith.”—She was afraid she had done her nothing but\\ndisservice.—It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\\ninstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\\nthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\\nnever have entered Harriet’s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\\nher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\\ngiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of\\nhaving encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\\nprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\\nwould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\\nto have prevented them.—She felt that she had been risking her friend’s\\nhappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have\\ndirected her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think\\nof him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his\\never caring for her.—“But, with common sense,” she added, “I am afraid\\nI have had little to do.”\\n\\nShe was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\\nwith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.—As for Jane\\nFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\\nsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no\\nlonger be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\\nhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.—Her\\ndays of insignificance and evil were over.—She would soon be well, and\\nhappy, and prosperous.—Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\\nhad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\\ndoubt it had been from jealousy.—In Jane’s eyes she had been a rival;\\nand well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\\nrepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\\nand arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\\nunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\\nthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\\nJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\\ndesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was\\nlittle sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\\nthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\\nConsidering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\\njudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet’s mind, producing\\nreserve and self-command, it would.—She must communicate the painful\\ntruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\\nbeen among Mr. Weston’s parting words. “For the present, the whole\\naffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\\nit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and\\nevery body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.”—Emma had\\npromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\\n\\nIn spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\\nridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\\noffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through\\nby herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to\\nher, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat\\nquick on hearing Harriet’s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had\\npoor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the\\nevent of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—But of that,\\nunfortunately, there could be no chance.\\n\\n“Well, Miss Woodhouse!” cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room—“is\\nnot this the oddest news that ever was?”\\n\\n“What news do you mean?” replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\\nvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\\n\\n“About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!—you\\nneed not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\\nhimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\\nand, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but\\nyou, but he said you knew it.”\\n\\n“What did Mr. Weston tell you?”—said Emma, still perplexed.\\n\\n“Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\\nare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\\nanother this long while. How very odd!”\\n\\nIt was, indeed, so odd; Harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that\\nEmma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\\nabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\\ndisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\\nher, quite unable to speak.\\n\\n“Had you any idea,” cried Harriet, “of his being in love with her?—You,\\nperhaps, might.—You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\\nbody’s heart; but nobody else—”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” said Emma, “I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\\nCan you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to\\nanother woman at the very time that I was—tacitly, if not\\nopenly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?—I never had\\nthe slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\\nChurchill’s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\\nsure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.”\\n\\n“Me!” cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. “Why should you caution\\nme?—You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.”\\n\\n“I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,” replied\\nEmma, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and\\nnot very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you\\ndid care about him?”\\n\\n“Him!—never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?”\\nturning away distressed.\\n\\n“Harriet!” cried Emma, after a moment’s pause—“What do you mean?—Good\\nHeaven! what do you mean?—Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then?—”\\n\\nShe could not speak another word.—Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\\nwaiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\\n\\nHarriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\\nher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\\nin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma’s.\\n\\n“I should not have thought it possible,” she began, “that you could\\nhave misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but\\nconsidering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should\\nnot have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other\\nperson. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look\\nat him in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than\\nto think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And\\nthat you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!—I am sure, but for\\nbelieving that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my\\nattachment, I should have considered it at first too great a\\npresumption almost, to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not\\ntold me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\\nmatches of greater disparity (those were your very words);—I should not\\nhave dared to give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if\\n_you_, who had been always acquainted with him—”\\n\\n“Harriet!” cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely—“Let us understand\\neach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\\nspeaking of—Mr. Knightley?”\\n\\n“To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else—and so I\\nthought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\\npossible.”\\n\\n“Not quite,” returned Emma, with forced calmness, “for all that you\\nthen said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could\\nalmost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the\\nservice Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from\\nthe gipsies, was spoken of.”\\n\\n“Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!”\\n\\n“My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\\nthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that\\nconsidering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\\nnatural:—and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\\nyour sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations\\nhad been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.—The impression of\\nit is strong on my memory.”\\n\\n“Oh, dear,” cried Harriet, “now I recollect what you mean; but I was\\nthinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\\ngipsies—it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\\nelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr.\\nKnightley’s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\\nstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\\nwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity;\\nthat was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to\\nevery other being upon earth.”\\n\\n“Good God!” cried Emma, “this has been a most unfortunate—most\\ndeplorable mistake!—What is to be done?”\\n\\n“You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\\nleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\\nother had been the person; and now—it _is_ possible—”\\n\\nShe paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\\n\\n“I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,” she resumed, “that you should feel a\\ngreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\\nthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\\nI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing—that if—strange as it may\\nappear—. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\\nthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place\\nthan between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if\\nsuch a thing even as this, may have occurred before—and if I should be\\nso fortunate, beyond expression, as to—if Mr. Knightley should\\nreally—if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss\\nWoodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put\\ndifficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure.”\\n\\nHarriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look\\nat her in consternation, and hastily said,\\n\\n“Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley’s returning your affection?”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully—“I must say that I\\nhave.”\\n\\nEmma’s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\\nin a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once\\nopening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched—she admitted—she\\nacknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet\\nshould be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why\\nwas the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet’s having some hope of a\\nreturn? It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr.\\nKnightley must marry no one but herself!\\n\\nHer own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\\nfew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\\nher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\\ninconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\\nher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck\\nher with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in\\nthe world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of\\nall these demerits—some concern for her own appearance, and a strong\\nsense of justice by Harriet—(there would be no need of _compassion_ to\\nthe girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley—but justice\\nrequired that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave\\nEmma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even\\napparent kindness.—For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the\\nutmost extent of Harriet’s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet\\nhad done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so\\nvoluntarily formed and maintained—or to deserve to be slighted by the\\nperson, whose counsels had never led her right.—Rousing from\\nreflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet\\nagain, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as\\nto the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of\\nJane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.—Neither of them thought but\\nof Mr. Knightley and themselves.\\n\\nHarriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\\nto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\\nand such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to\\ngive the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\\ndelight.—Emma’s tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were\\nbetter concealed than Harriet’s, but they were not less. Her voice was\\nnot unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a\\ndevelopment of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion\\nof sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.—She listened with much\\ninward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet’s\\ndetail.—Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could\\nnot be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the\\nfeebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her\\nspirit—especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own\\nmemory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley’s most improved opinion of\\nHarriet.\\n\\nHarriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dances.—Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\\nfound her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\\nleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse’s encouraging her to think of\\nhim, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more\\nthan he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different\\nmanner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!—Latterly she\\nhad been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking\\ntogether, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\\ndelightfully!—He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\\nto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\\nalmost the same extent.—Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and\\npraise from him—and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with\\nwhat she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being\\nwithout art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\\nfeelings.—She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had\\ndwelt on them to her more than once.—Much that lived in Harriet’s\\nmemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\\nhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a\\ncompliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because\\nunsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour’s\\nrelation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had\\npassed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest\\noccurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet,\\nwere not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.—The first,\\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at\\nDonwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he\\nhad taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to\\nhimself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way\\nthan he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet\\ncould not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking\\nher, whether her affections were engaged.—But as soon as she (Miss\\nWoodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and\\nbegan talking about farming:—The second, was his having sat talking\\nwith her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the\\nvery last morning of his being at Hartfield—though, when he first came\\nin, he had said that he could not stay five minutes—and his having told\\nher, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it\\nwas very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which\\nwas much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The\\nsuperior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article\\nmarked, gave her severe pain.\\n\\nOn the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\\nlittle reflection, venture the following question. “Might he not?—Is\\nnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\\nyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin—he might have Mr.\\nMartin’s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\\nspirit.\\n\\n“Mr. Martin! No indeed!—There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\\nknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of\\nit.”\\n\\nWhen Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\\nWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\\n\\n“I never should have presumed to think of it at first,” said she, “but\\nfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour be\\nthe rule of mine—and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\\ndeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\\nvery wonderful.”\\n\\nThe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\\nfeelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma’s side, to enable\\nher to say on reply,\\n\\n“Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the\\nlast man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea\\nof his feeling for her more than he really does.”\\n\\nHarriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\\nsatisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\\nat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\\nfather’s footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\\nmuch agitated to encounter him. “She could not compose herself— Mr.\\nWoodhouse would be alarmed—she had better go;”—with most ready\\nencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\\nanother door—and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous\\nburst of Emma’s feelings: “Oh God! that I had never seen her!”\\n\\nThe rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\\nthoughts.—She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\\nrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\\nfresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\\nher.—How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\\nbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!—The blunders, the\\nblindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still, she walked about,\\nshe tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery—in every place, every\\nposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\\nbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\\nbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was\\nwretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\\nwretchedness.\\n\\nTo understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\\nendeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father’s\\nclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\\n\\nHow long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\\ndeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?—\\nWhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\\nChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?—She looked back; she\\ncompared the two—compared them, as they had always stood in her\\nestimation, from the time of the latter’s becoming known to her—and as\\nthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it—oh! had it, by\\nany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.—She\\nsaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\\nKnightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had\\nnot been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\\nin fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\\ndelusion, totally ignorant of her own heart—and, in short, that she had\\nnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\\n\\nThis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the\\nknowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she\\nreached; and without being long in reaching it.—She was most\\nsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\\nto her—her affection for Mr. Knightley.—Every other part of her mind\\nwas disgusting.\\n\\nWith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of\\nevery body’s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange\\nevery body’s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken;\\nand she had not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief. She had\\nbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\\nKnightley.—Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\\nher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\\nattachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\\nHarriet’s;—and even were this not the case, he would never have known\\nHarriet at all but for her folly.\\n\\nMr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance every\\nwonder of the kind.—The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\\nbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\\nsurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\\nthought.—Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!—Such an elevation on her\\nside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\\nmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the\\nsneers, the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification\\nand disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to\\nhimself.—Could it be?—No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very\\nfar, from impossible.—Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate\\nabilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one,\\nperhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek\\nhim?—Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal,\\ninconsistent, incongruous—or for chance and circumstance (as second\\ncauses) to direct the human fate?\\n\\nOh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\\nought, and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not, with a folly\\nwhich no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\\nunexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\\nin the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been\\nsafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\\n\\nHow Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts\\nto Mr. Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of\\nsuch a man till actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble,\\nhad fewer scruples than formerly.—Her inferiority, whether of mind or\\nsituation, seemed little felt.—She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\\nElton’s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\\nKnightley’s.—Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\\npains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?—Who but\\nherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\\nand that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?—If\\nHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nTill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\\nhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\\nfirst in interest and affection.—Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\\nit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\\ndread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\\nbeen.—Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\\nfemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\\ncould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\\nhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\\nmany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\\nor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\\ninsensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he\\nwould not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but\\nstill, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of\\nmind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an\\nendeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no\\nother creature had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew\\nshe was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?—When the suggestions\\nof hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she\\ncould not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself\\nnot unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by\\nMr. Knightley. _She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any\\nidea of blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very\\nrecent proof of its impartiality.—How shocked had he been by her\\nbehaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed\\nhimself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but\\nfar, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright\\njustice and clear-sighted goodwill.—She had no hope, nothing to deserve\\nthe name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself\\nwhich was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one,\\nat times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and\\nbe overrating his regard for _her_.—Wish it she must, for his sake—be\\nthe consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his\\nlife. Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at\\nall, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.—Let him but\\ncontinue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr.\\nKnightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of\\ntheir precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace\\nwould be fully secured.—Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It\\nwould be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what\\nshe felt for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She\\nwould not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\\n\\nIt must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\\nhoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be\\nable to ascertain what the chances for it were.—She should see them\\nhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\\nhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know\\nhow to admit that she could be blinded here.—He was expected back every\\nday. The power of observation would be soon given—frightfully soon it\\nappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\\nresolved against seeing Harriet.—It would do neither of them good, it\\nwould do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.—She was\\nresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\\nno authority for opposing Harriet’s confidence. To talk would be only\\nto irritate.—She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to\\nbeg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it\\nto be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\\ntopic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were\\nallowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of\\nothers—she objected only to a tête-à-tête—they might be able to act as\\nif they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—Harriet submitted,\\nand approved, and was grateful.\\n\\nThis point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma’s\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\\nsleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours—Mrs. Weston, who had\\nbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\\nway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\\nrelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\\n\\nMr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates’s, and gone through his\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\\ninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\\nmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a\\nquarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates’s parlour, with all the\\nencumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.\\n\\nA little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\\nfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\\nof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at\\nall at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead,\\nand to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and\\nMr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known;\\nas, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\\nwithout leading to reports:—but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\\nwas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\\nfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\\nor if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for “such things,”\\nhe observed, “always got about.” Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\\nhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short—and very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\\nhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\\nhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\\nsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\\ndaughter—who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\\ngratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\\nrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\\nthought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\\nthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\\nFairfax’s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\\ninvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\\non being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs.\\nWeston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\\nembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\\nApologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first\\nreception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always\\nfeeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the\\ncause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good\\ndeal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs.\\nWeston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief\\nto her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so\\nlong been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the\\nsubject.\\n\\n“On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\\nmany months,” continued Mrs. Weston, “she was energetic. This was one\\nof her expressions. ‘I will not say, that since I entered into the\\nengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I\\nhave never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering\\nlip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my\\nheart.”\\n\\n“Poor girl!” said Emma. “She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\\nconsented to a private engagement?”\\n\\n“Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to\\nblame herself. ‘The consequence,’ said she, ‘has been a state of\\nperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the\\npunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\\nPain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting\\ncontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\\nthing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\\nconscience tells me ought not to be.’ ‘Do not imagine, madam,’ she\\ncontinued, ‘that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on\\nthe principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error\\nhas been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that\\npresent circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the\\nstory known to Colonel Campbell.’”\\n\\n“Poor girl!” said Emma again. “She loves him then excessively, I\\nsuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led\\nto form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\\njudgment.”\\n\\n“Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.”\\n\\n“I am afraid,” returned Emma, sighing, “that I must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy.”\\n\\n“On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she probably\\nhad something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\\nmisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\\nconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,” she said, “was\\nthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\\namiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\\nand irritable to a degree that must have been—that had been—hard for\\nhim to bear. ‘I did not make the allowances,’ said she, ‘which I ought\\nto have done, for his temper and spirits—his delightful spirits, and\\nthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\\ncircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\\nme, as they were at first.’ She then began to speak of you, and of the\\ngreat kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\\nwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an\\nopportunity, to thank you—I could not thank you too much—for every wish\\nand every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had never\\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself.”\\n\\n“If I did not know her to be happy now,” said Emma, seriously, “which,\\nin spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\\nmust be, I could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\\nwere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\\nFairfax!—Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is\\nall to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\\nparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\\nvery good—I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.”\\n\\nSuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\\nwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved\\nhim very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with\\na great deal of reason, and at least equal affection—but she had too\\nmuch to urge for Emma’s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square\\nor to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston\\nended with, “We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you\\nknow, but I hope it will soon come,” she was obliged to pause before\\nshe answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could\\nat all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\\n\\n“Are you well, my Emma?” was Mrs. Weston’s parting question.\\n\\n“Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.”\\n\\nMrs. Weston’s communications furnished Emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\\nsense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\\nnot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\\nenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\\nHad she followed Mr. Knightley’s known wishes, in paying that attention\\nto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\\nbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to\\nfind a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\\nprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\\nnow.—Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\\nan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other—what\\nwas she?—Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\\nthat she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax’s confidence on this\\nimportant matter—which was most probable—still, in knowing her as she\\nought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\\nabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\\nhad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\\nsubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane’s feelings, by the\\nlevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill’s. Of all the sources of evil\\nsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\\nthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\\nperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\\nher having stabbed Jane Fairfax’s peace in a thousand instances; and on\\nBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\\nmore.\\n\\nThe evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\\nThe weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in,\\nand nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the\\nwind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such\\ncruel sights the longer visible.\\n\\nThe weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter’s side, and\\nby exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\\nher of their first forlorn tête-à-tête, on the evening of Mrs. Weston’s\\nwedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and\\ndissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\\nHartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\\nbe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\\napproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\\nno pleasures had been lost.—But her present forebodings she feared\\nwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that\\nmight not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might\\ntake place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\\ncomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\\nspirits only of ruined happiness.\\n\\nThe child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\\nherself; and Mrs. Weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. They\\nshould lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\\nalso.—Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\\nFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\\nHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near\\nEnscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these\\nlosses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of\\ncheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be\\nno longer coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at\\nall hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their’s!—How\\nwas it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet’s\\nsake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet’s\\nsociety all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the\\nfirst, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the\\nbest blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma’s\\nwretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind, that\\nit had been all her own work?\\n\\nWhen it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\\na start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few\\nseconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or\\ncomposure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\\nconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\\nbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\\nwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\\nleave her less to regret when it were gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the\\nsame loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\\nHartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\\nsofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\\nsummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,\\nEmma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the\\nexquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and\\nbrilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for\\nthe serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry’s coming\\nin soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she\\nlost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.—There, with spirits\\nfreshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,\\nwhen she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\\ntowards her.—It was the first intimation of his being returned from\\nLondon. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as\\nunquestionably sixteen miles distant.—There was time only for the\\nquickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a\\nminute they were together. The “How d’ye do’s” were quiet and\\nconstrained on each side. She asked after their mutual friends; they\\nwere all well.—When had he left them?—Only that morning. He must have\\nhad a wet ride.—Yes.—He meant to walk with her, she found. “He had just\\nlooked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there, preferred\\nbeing out of doors.”—She thought he neither looked nor spoke\\ncheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her\\nfears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his\\nbrother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.\\n\\nThey walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\\nat her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\\ngive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\\nspeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\\nencouragement to begin.—She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\\nway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could not\\nbear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\\nconsidered—resolved—and, trying to smile, began—\\n\\n“You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\\nsurprize you.”\\n\\n“Have I?” said he quietly, and looking at her; “of what nature?”\\n\\n“Oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”\\n\\nAfter waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\\nhe replied,\\n\\n“If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\\nalready.”\\n\\n“How is it possible?” cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\\nhim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\\nat Mrs. Goddard’s in his way.\\n\\n“I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\\nat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”\\n\\nEmma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\\ncomposure,\\n\\n“_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\\nhad your suspicions.—I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\\nme a caution.—I wish I had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and\\na heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.”\\n\\nFor a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of\\nhaving excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn\\nwithin his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,\\nin a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\\n\\n“Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.—Your own excellent\\nsense—your exertions for your father’s sake—I know you will not allow\\nyourself—.” Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken\\nand subdued accent, “The feelings of the warmest\\nfriendship—Indignation—Abominable scoundrel!”—And in a louder, steadier\\ntone, he concluded with, “He will soon be gone. They will soon be in\\nYorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.”\\n\\nEmma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\\nof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\\n\\n“You are very kind—but you are mistaken—and I must set you right.— I am\\nnot in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going\\non, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of,\\nand I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\\nwell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\\nto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.”\\n\\n“Emma!” cried he, looking eagerly at her, “are you, indeed?”—but\\nchecking himself—“No, no, I understand you—forgive me—I am pleased that\\nyou can say even so much.—He is no object of regret, indeed! and it\\nwill not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\\nof more than your reason.—Fortunate that your affections were not\\nfarther entangled!—I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\\nmyself as to the degree of what you felt—I could only be certain that\\nthere was a preference—and a preference which I never believed him to\\ndeserve.—He is a disgrace to the name of man.—And is he to be rewarded\\nwith that sweet young woman?—Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\\ncreature.”\\n\\n“Mr. Knightley,” said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused—“I\\nam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\\nerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\\nhave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\\nat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be\\nnatural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.—But I\\nnever have.”\\n\\nHe listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\\nnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\\nclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself\\nin his opinion. She went on, however.\\n\\n“I have very little to say for my own conduct.—I was tempted by his\\nattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.—An old story,\\nprobably—a common case—and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\\nsex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\\nas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\\nHe was the son of Mr. Weston—he was continually here—I always found him\\nvery pleasant—and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\\ncauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last—my vanity\\nwas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however—for some\\ntime, indeed—I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.—I thought\\nthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\\nHe has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\\nattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\\nnever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\\nsituation with another.—It was his object to blind all about him; and\\nno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself—except\\nthat I was _not_ blinded—that it was my good fortune—that, in short, I\\nwas somehow or other safe from him.”\\n\\nShe had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her\\nconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as\\nshe could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual\\ntone, he said,\\n\\n“I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.—I can suppose,\\nhowever, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\\nbeen but trifling.—And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\\nmay yet turn out well.—With such a woman he has a chance.—I have no\\nmotive for wishing him ill—and for her sake, whose happiness will be\\ninvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\\nwell.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt of their being happy together,” said Emma; “I believe\\nthem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.”\\n\\n“He is a most fortunate man!” returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. “So\\nearly in life—at three-and-twenty—a period when, if a man chuses a\\nwife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a\\nprize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has\\nbefore him!—Assured of the love of such a woman—the disinterested love,\\nfor Jane Fairfax’s character vouches for her disinterestedness; every\\nthing in his favour,—equality of situation—I mean, as far as regards\\nsociety, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in\\nevery point but one—and that one, since the purity of her heart is not\\nto be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his\\nto bestow the only advantages she wants.—A man would always wish to\\ngive a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who\\ncan do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must, I think, be\\nthe happiest of mortals.—Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of\\nfortune. Every thing turns out for his good.—He meets with a young\\nwoman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her\\nby negligent treatment—and had he and all his family sought round the\\nworld for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found her\\nsuperior.—His aunt is in the way.—His aunt dies.—He has only to\\nspeak.—His friends are eager to promote his happiness.—He had used\\nevery body ill—and they are all delighted to forgive him.—He is a\\nfortunate man indeed!”\\n\\n“You speak as if you envied him.”\\n\\n“And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.”\\n\\nEmma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of\\nHarriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\\npossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\\ndifferent—the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\\nbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\\n\\n“You will not ask me what is the point of envy.—You are determined, I\\nsee, to have no curiosity.—You are wise—but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma, I\\nmust tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\\nnext moment.”\\n\\n“Oh! then, don’t speak it, don’t speak it,” she eagerly cried. “Take a\\nlittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\\nanother syllable followed.\\n\\nEmma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\\nher—perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would, she would listen.\\nShe might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\\njust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own\\nindependence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be\\nmore intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.—They had\\nreached the house.\\n\\n“You are going in, I suppose?” said he.\\n\\n“No,”—replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he\\nstill spoke—“I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\\ngone.” And, after proceeding a few steps, she added—“I stopped you\\nungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\\npain.—But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to\\nask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation—as a\\nfriend, indeed, you may command me.—I will hear whatever you like. I\\nwill tell you exactly what I think.”\\n\\n“As a friend!”—repeated Mr. Knightley.—“Emma, that I fear is a word—No,\\nI have no wish—Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?—I have gone too far\\nalready for concealment.—Emma, I accept your offer—Extraordinary as it\\nmay seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.—Tell me,\\nthen, have I no chance of ever succeeding?”\\n\\nHe stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\\nof his eyes overpowered her.\\n\\n“My dearest Emma,” said he, “for dearest you will always be, whatever\\nthe event of this hour’s conversation, my dearest, most beloved\\nEmma—tell me at once. Say ‘No,’ if it is to be said.”—She could really\\nsay nothing.—“You are silent,” he cried, with great animation;\\n“absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.”\\n\\nEmma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\\ndread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\\nprominent feeling.\\n\\n“I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon resumed; and in a tone of such\\nsincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\\nconvincing.—“If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\\nmore. But you know what I am.—You hear nothing but truth from me.—I\\nhave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\\nwoman in England would have borne it.—Bear with the truths I would tell\\nyou now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner,\\nperhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a\\nvery indifferent lover.—But you understand me.—Yes, you see, you\\nunderstand my feelings—and will return them if you can. At present, I\\nask only to hear, once to hear your voice.”\\n\\nWhile he spoke, Emma’s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\\nvelocity of thought, had been able—and yet without losing a word—to\\ncatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\\nHarriet’s hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as\\ncomplete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that\\nshe was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to\\nHarriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and\\nthat her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had\\nbeen all received as discouragement from herself.—And not only was\\nthere time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant\\nhappiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet’s secret had not\\nescaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.—It was\\nall the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of\\nthat heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him\\nto transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the\\nmost worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving\\nto refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive,\\nbecause he could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for\\nHarriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run\\nmad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her\\nbrain. She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her\\nfor ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong\\nas it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him,\\nas most unequal and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite\\nsmooth.—She spoke then, on being so entreated.—What did she say?—Just\\nwhat she ought, of course. A lady always does.—She said enough to shew\\nthere need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself. He\\n_had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to\\ncaution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;—she had begun\\nby refusing to hear him.—The change had perhaps been somewhat\\nsudden;—her proposal of taking another turn, her renewing the\\nconversation which she had just put an end to, might be a little\\nextraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so\\nobliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.\\n\\nSeldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human\\ndisclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little\\ndisguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the\\nconduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very\\nmaterial.—Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart\\nthan she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\\n\\nHe had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\\nfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\\nin his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill’s engagement, with\\nno selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed\\nhim an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.—The rest had been the work\\nof the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings.\\nThe delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank\\nChurchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had\\ngiven birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection\\nhimself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only, in the momentary\\nconquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did\\nnot forbid his attempt to attach her.—The superior hopes which\\ngradually opened were so much the more enchanting.—The affection, which\\nhe had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already\\nhis!—Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed\\nstate of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could\\nbear no other name.\\n\\n_Her_ change was equal.—This one half-hour had given to each the same\\nprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\\ndegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.—On his side, there had been\\na long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\\nof Frank Churchill.—He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\\nChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\\nenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\\nthat had taken him from the country.—The Box Hill party had decided him\\non going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such\\npermitted, encouraged attentions.—He had gone to learn to be\\nindifferent.—But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\\ndomestic happiness in his brother’s house; woman wore too amiable a\\nform in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only in those\\nstriking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy\\nbefore him, for much to have been done, even had his time been\\nlonger.—He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day—till this\\nvery morning’s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.—Then,\\nwith the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to\\nfeel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving\\nEmma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,\\nthat he could stay no longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and\\nhad walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best\\nof all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the\\ndiscovery.\\n\\nHe had found her agitated and low.—Frank Churchill was a villain.— He\\nheard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill’s\\ncharacter was not desperate.—She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\\nwhen they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of\\nFrank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of\\nfellow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\\nwhat she had brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a\\nlittle respite of suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of\\nhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\\ngreater when the flutter should have passed away.\\n\\nThey sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often it\\nhad been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\\nshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\\nwestern sun!—But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\\nlike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\\nusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\\ndaughter.\\n\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in\\nthe breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so\\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.—Could he have\\nseen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but\\nwithout the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the\\nslightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of\\neither, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news\\nhe had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much\\nself-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him\\nin return.\\n\\nAs long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma’s fever continued;\\nbut when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\\nsubdued—and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for\\nsuch an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to\\nconsider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\\nalloy. Her father—and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\\nthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\\nof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it\\nwas a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\\nwould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\\nsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.—She even wept over the\\nidea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\\nengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger\\nof drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.—How\\nto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;—how to spare\\nher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\\nhow to appear least her enemy?—On these subjects, her perplexity and\\ndistress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again\\nthrough every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\\nsurrounded it.—She could only resolve at last, that she would still\\navoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\\nletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\\njust now for a time from Highbury, and—indulging in one scheme\\nmore—nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\nfor her to Brunswick Square.—Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\\nand a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.—She did\\nnot think it in Harriet’s nature to escape being benefited by novelty\\nand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.—At any rate,\\nit would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\\nevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\\nevil day, when they must all be together again.\\n\\nShe rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\\nleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\\nup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\\nan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\\nliterally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\\nproper share of the happiness of the evening before.\\n\\nHe had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\\nslightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\\nbrought her from Randalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must\\ncontain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.—She was now in\\nperfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\\nwanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding\\nany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.—It must be\\nwaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a\\nnote from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\\nMrs. Weston.\\n\\n“I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\\nenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have\\nscarcely a doubt of its happy effect.—I think we shall never materially\\ndisagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long\\npreface.—We are quite well.—This letter has been the cure of all the\\nlittle nervousness I have been feeling lately.—I did not quite like\\nyour looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you\\nwill never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a\\nnorth-east wind.—I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of\\nTuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing\\nlast night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\\n\\n“Yours ever,\\n“A. W.”\\n\\n\\n[_To Mrs. Weston_.]\\n\\n\\nWindsor—July.\\n\\n\\nMY DEAR MADAM,\\n\\n\\n“If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;\\nbut expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\\nindulgence.—You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\\neven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.—But\\nI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\\nrises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\\nhumble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\\npardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\\nand of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.—You\\nmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when\\nI first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret\\nwhich was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to\\nplace myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another\\nquestion. I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it\\na right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,\\nand casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\\ndifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\\nrequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\\nparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\\ncreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.—Had she refused, I\\nshould have gone mad.—But you will be ready to say, what was your hope\\nin doing this?—What did you look forward to?—To any thing, every\\nthing—to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\\nperseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\\ngood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining\\nher promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther\\nexplanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband’s\\nson, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good,\\nwhich no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value\\nof.—See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit\\nto Randalls;—and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might\\nhave been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come\\ntill Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person\\nslighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father’s\\ncompassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from\\nhis house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour,\\nduring the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I\\nhope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I\\ncome to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while\\nbelonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very\\nsolicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and the warmest\\nfriendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I\\nought to add, with the deepest humiliation.—A few words which dropped\\nfrom him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge\\nmyself liable to.—My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe,\\nmore than it ought.—In order to assist a concealment so essential to\\nme, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of\\nintimacy into which we were immediately thrown.—I cannot deny that Miss\\nWoodhouse was my ostensible object—but I am sure you will believe the\\ndeclaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would\\nnot have been induced by any selfish views to go on.—Amiable and\\ndelightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young\\nwoman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any\\ntendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my\\nwish.—She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured\\nplayfulness, which exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each\\nother. From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and\\nwere felt to be so.—Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand\\nme before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;—when I called\\nto take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of\\nconfessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion;\\nbut I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some\\ndegree.—She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must\\nhave penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find, whenever the\\nsubject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take\\nher wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it. I remember\\nher telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her\\nattentions to Miss Fairfax.—I hope this history of my conduct towards\\nher will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what\\nyou saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\\nWoodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\\nprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of\\nthat said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\\naffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\\nmyself.—Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\\nyou have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\\nget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\\nIf you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.—Of\\nthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\\nits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F—, who would never\\nhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.—The delicacy\\nof her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much\\nbeyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly hope,\\nknow her thoroughly yourself.—No description can describe her. She must\\ntell you herself what she is—yet not by word, for never was there a\\nhuman creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.—Since I\\nbegan this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard\\nfrom her.—She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never\\ncomplains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of her looks.\\nI know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.\\nPerhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without delay; I am\\nimpatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few minutes I was at\\nRandalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much\\nbetter yet; still insane either from happiness or misery. When I think\\nof the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and\\npatience, and my uncle’s generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I\\nrecollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve\\nto be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her again!—But\\nI must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to\\nencroach.—I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard all\\nthat you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\\nyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\\nwith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the\\nevent of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me\\nthe happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early\\nmeasures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not\\nan hour to lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty,\\nand she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength\\nand refinement.—But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had\\nentered into with that woman—Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to\\nleave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.—I have been\\nwalking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make\\nthe rest of my letter what it ought to be.—It is, in fact, a most\\nmortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can\\nadmit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were\\nhighly blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been\\nenough.—My plea of concealing the truth she did not think\\nsufficient.—She was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought\\nher, on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I\\nthought her even cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her\\njudgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed\\nproper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever\\nknown.—We quarrelled.— Do you remember the morning spent at\\nDonwell?—_There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before\\ncame to a crisis. I was late; I met her walking home by herself, and\\nwanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely\\nrefused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now,\\nhowever, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree\\nof discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was\\nbehaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,\\nwas she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\\nevery previous caution useless?—Had we been met walking together\\nbetween Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.—I was\\nmad enough, however, to resent.—I doubted her affection. I doubted it\\nmore the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my\\nside, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent\\ndevotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of\\nsense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly\\nintelligible to me.—In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless\\non her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to\\nRichmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning,\\nmerely because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I\\nwas not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was\\nthe injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined\\nthat she should make the first advances.—I shall always congratulate\\nmyself that you were not of the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my\\nbehaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well\\nof me again. Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it\\nproduced: as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she\\nclosed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of\\nwhose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation\\nand hatred. I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has\\nbeen so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly\\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known.—‘Jane,’\\nindeed!—You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling\\nher by that name, even to you. Think, then, what I must have endured in\\nhearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of\\nneedless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.\\nHave patience with me, I shall soon have done.—She closed with this\\noffer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to\\ntell me that we never were to meet again.—_She_ _felt_ _the_\\n_engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_\\n_to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.—This letter reached me on the very\\nmorning of my poor aunt’s death. I answered it within an hour; but from\\nthe confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on\\nme at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other\\nletters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting\\nthat I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her,\\nremained without any uneasiness.—I was rather disappointed that I did\\nnot hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was\\ntoo busy, and—may I add?—too cheerful in my views to be captious.—We\\nremoved to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from\\nher, my own letters all returned!—and a few lines at the same time by\\nthe post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest\\nreply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could\\nnot be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to\\nhave every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she\\nnow sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that\\nif I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury\\nwithin a week, I would forward them after that period to her at—: in\\nshort, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge’s, near Bristol, stared me\\nin the face. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and\\ninstantly saw what she had been doing. It was perfectly accordant with\\nthat resolution of character which I knew her to possess; and the\\nsecrecy she had maintained, as to any such design in her former letter,\\nwas equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy. For the world would\\nnot she have seemed to threaten me.—Imagine the shock; imagine how,\\ntill I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of\\nthe post.—What was to be done?—One thing only.—I must speak to my\\nuncle. Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.—I\\nspoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened\\naway his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,\\nwholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with\\na deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the\\nmarriage state as he had done.—I felt that it would be of a different\\nsort.—Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in\\nopening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?—No;\\ndo not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.\\nDo not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.—I reached Highbury at\\nthe time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I\\nwas certain of a good chance of finding her alone.—I was not\\ndisappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object\\nof my journey. A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I\\nhad to persuade away. But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much\\ndearer, than ever, and no moment’s uneasiness can ever occur between us\\nagain. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude\\nbefore. A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have\\never shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will\\ndictate towards her.—If you think me in a way to be happier than I\\ndeserve, I am quite of your opinion.—Miss W. calls me the child of good\\nfortune. I hope she is right.—In one respect, my good fortune is\\nundoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself,\\n\\nYour obliged and affectionate Son,\\n\\nF. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nThis letter must make its way to Emma’s feelings. She was obliged, in\\nspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\\njustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\\nit was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\\nand almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the\\nsubject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her\\nformer regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any\\npicture of love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till\\nshe had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to\\nfeel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had\\nsupposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful\\nto Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so\\nhappy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have\\nentered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as\\never.\\n\\nShe thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\\nshe desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston’s wishing it to\\nbe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen\\nso much to blame in his conduct.\\n\\n“I shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “but it seems long. I\\nwill take it home with me at night.”\\n\\nBut that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\\nmust return it by him.\\n\\n“I would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a\\nmatter of justice, it shall be done.”\\n\\nHe began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, “Had I been offered\\nthe sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law a few\\nmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”\\n\\nHe proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\\nsmile, observed, “Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\\nway. One man’s style must not be the rule of another’s. We will not be\\nsevere.”\\n\\n“It will be natural for me,” he added shortly afterwards, “to speak my\\nopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\\nIt will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—”\\n\\n“Not at all. I should wish it.”\\n\\nMr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\\n\\n“He trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. He knows he is\\nwrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He ought not to have\\nformed the engagement.—‘His father’s disposition:’—he is unjust,\\nhowever, to his father. Mr. Weston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on\\nall his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every\\npresent comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he did not\\ncome till Miss Fairfax was here.”\\n\\n“And I have not forgotten,” said Emma, “how sure you were that he might\\nhave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely—but you\\nwere perfectly right.”\\n\\n“I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had\\n_you_ not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him.”\\n\\nWhen he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\\naloud—all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\\nhead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\\nthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\\nreflection, thus—\\n\\n“Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous\\ngame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.—No judge of his\\nown manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\\nregardless of little besides his own convenience.—Fancying you to have\\nfathomed his secret. Natural enough!—his own mind full of intrigue,\\nthat he should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert\\nthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\\nand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with\\neach other?”\\n\\nEmma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet’s\\naccount, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\\n\\n“You had better go on,” said she.\\n\\nHe did so, but very soon stopt again to say, “the pianoforte! Ah! That\\nwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider\\nwhether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the\\npleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man’s wishing\\nto give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather\\ndispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the\\ninstrument’s coming if she could.”\\n\\nAfter this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill’s\\nconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\\nmore than a word in passing.\\n\\n“I perfectly agree with you, sir,”—was then his remark. “You did behave\\nvery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.” And having gone through\\nwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\\npersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax’s sense of\\nright, he made a fuller pause to say, “This is very bad.—He had induced\\nher to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme\\ndifficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to\\nprevent her from suffering unnecessarily.—She must have had much more\\nto contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He\\nshould have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such;\\nbut hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and\\nremember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the\\nengagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of\\npunishment.”\\n\\nEmma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\\nuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\\ndeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\\nhowever, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\\nexcepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\\nof giving pain—no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\\n\\n“There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\\nEltons,” was his next observation.—“His feelings are natural.—What!\\nactually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the engagement to\\nbe a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it.—What a\\nview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!—Well, he must be a most\\nextraordinary—”\\n\\n“Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he suffers.”\\n\\n“I hope he does,” replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the\\nletter. “‘Smallridge!’—What does this mean? What is all this?”\\n\\n“She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge’s children—a\\ndear friend of Mrs. Elton’s—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\\nbye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?”\\n\\n“Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of\\nMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\\nthe man writes!”\\n\\n“I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.”\\n\\n“Well, there _is_ feeling here.—He does seem to have suffered in\\nfinding her ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\\nher. ‘Dearer, much dearer than ever.’ I hope he may long continue to\\nfeel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He is a very liberal\\nthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.—‘Happier than I\\ndeserve.’ Come, he knows himself there. ‘Miss Woodhouse calls me the\\nchild of good fortune.’—Those were Miss Woodhouse’s words, were they?—\\nAnd a fine ending—and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\\nThat was your name for him, was it?”\\n\\n“You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\\nyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\\nhope it does him some service with you.”\\n\\n“Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\\nin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\\nis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\\nmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am\\nvery ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers\\nthe steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me\\ntalk to you of something else. I have another person’s interest at\\npresent so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank\\nChurchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been\\nhard at work on one subject.”\\n\\nThe subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\\nEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\\nwith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\\nhappiness of her father. Emma’s answer was ready at the first word.\\n“While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be\\nimpossible for her. She could never quit him.” Part only of this\\nanswer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her\\nfather, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the\\ninadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been\\nthinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to\\ninduce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to\\nbelieve it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not\\nsuffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his\\npersuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father’s\\ncomfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr.\\nWoodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he felt that it ought not to be\\nattempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he\\ntrusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;\\nit was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her\\nfather’s happiness—in other words, his life—required Hartfield to\\ncontinue her home, it should be his likewise.\\n\\nOf their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\\nthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\\nan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\\nthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\\nbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\\nin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\\nwould be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of\\nit, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced,\\nthat no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the\\nsubject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm\\nconsideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole\\nmorning, to have his thoughts to himself.\\n\\n“Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,” cried Emma. “I am sure\\nWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\\nask mine.”\\n\\nShe promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\\nmoreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\\nscheme.\\n\\nIt is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\\nwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck\\nwith any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\\nheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she\\nmust of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she\\nonly gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement\\nin detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley’s\\nmarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\\nwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\\n\\nThis proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\\nHartfield—the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\\nHis evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their\\nmutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in\\nthe periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!—Such a partner in\\nall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\\nmelancholy!\\n\\nShe would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\\nof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\\nwho must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\\nparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\\ncharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\\nevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\\nfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead\\nweight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\\npeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state\\nof unmerited punishment.\\n\\nIn time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\\nsupplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\\nKnightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like\\nMr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\\nconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\\nthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\\ncould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\\nherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\\nletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\\n\\nHarriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\\nreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\\nwas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her\\nstyle, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.—It\\nmight be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only\\ncould have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\\n\\nShe had no difficulty in procuring Isabella’s invitation; and she was\\nfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without\\nresorting to invention.—There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished,\\nand had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\\ndelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\\nher—and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\\nquite eager to have Harriet under her care.—When it was thus settled on\\nher sister’s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very\\npersuadable.—Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\\nfortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse’s carriage.—It was\\nall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\\nSquare.\\n\\nNow Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley’s visits; now she could\\ntalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\\nof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted\\nher when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much\\nmight at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the\\nfeelings which she had led astray herself.\\n\\nThe difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard’s, or in London, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in Emma’s sensations; but she could not\\nthink of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,\\nwhich must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\\n\\nShe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication\\nbefore her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make—the\\nconfession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing\\nto do with it at present.—She had resolved to defer the disclosure till\\nMrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be\\nthrown at this period among those she loved—and the evil should not act\\non herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—A fortnight, at\\nleast, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more\\nagitating, delight, should be hers.\\n\\nShe soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\\nhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.—She ought\\nto go—and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\\nsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\\n_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of\\nprospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should\\nattend to any thing Jane might communicate.\\n\\nShe went—she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\\nbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane\\nhad been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all\\nthe worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.—The fear of being\\nstill unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home,\\nto wait in the passage, and send up her name.—She heard Patty\\nannouncing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had\\nbefore made so happily intelligible.—No; she heard nothing but the\\ninstant reply of, “Beg her to walk up;”—and a moment afterwards she was\\nmet on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no\\nother reception of her were felt sufficient.—Emma had never seen her\\nlook so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness,\\nanimation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or\\nmanner could ever have wanted.— She came forward with an offered hand;\\nand said, in a low, but very feeling tone,\\n\\n“This is most kind, indeed!—Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to\\nexpress—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely without\\nwords.”\\n\\nEmma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\\nsound of Mrs. Elton’s voice from the sitting-room had not checked her,\\nand made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\\ncongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\\n\\nMrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\\naccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\\nElton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\\nbody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped\\nthe rencontre would do them no harm.\\n\\nShe soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton’s thoughts, and\\nunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\\nMiss Fairfax’s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what\\nwas still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately\\nin the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to\\nMrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady’s replies, she\\nsaw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which\\nshe had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it\\ninto the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant\\nnods,\\n\\n“We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\\nopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already.\\nI only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\\nnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\\ncreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.—But not a word\\nmore. Let us be discreet—quite on our good behaviour.—Hush!—You\\nremember those lines—I forget the poem at this moment:\\n\\n“For when a lady’s in the case,\\n“You know all other things give place.”\\n\\n\\nNow I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read——mum! a word to the\\nwise.—I am in a fine flow of spirits, an’t I? But I want to set your\\nheart at ease as to Mrs. S.—_My_ representation, you see, has quite\\nappeased her.”\\n\\nAnd again, on Emma’s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates’s\\nknitting, she added, in a half whisper,\\n\\n“I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.—Oh! no; cautious as a\\nminister of state. I managed it extremely well.”\\n\\nEmma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\\npossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony\\nof the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed\\nwith,\\n\\n“Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\\ncharmingly recovered?—Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\\ncredit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\\nword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—Oh! if you had\\nseen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!”—And when Mrs. Bates was\\nsaying something to Emma, whispered farther, “We do not say a word of\\nany _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\\nphysician from Windsor.—Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.”\\n\\n“I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,” she\\nshortly afterwards began, “since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\\nparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\\nseem—that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.—So\\nit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\\nit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to\\nour collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while\\nthe fine weather lasts?—It must be the same party, you know, quite the\\nsame party, not _one_ exception.”\\n\\nSoon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\\ndiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\\nshe supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\\nevery thing.\\n\\n“Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.—It is impossible\\nto say—Yes, indeed, I quite understand—dearest Jane’s prospects—that\\nis, I do not mean.—But she is charmingly recovered.—How is Mr.\\nWoodhouse?—I am so glad.—Quite out of my power.—Such a happy little\\ncircle as you find us here.—Yes, indeed.—Charming young man!—that is—so\\nvery friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!—such attention to Jane!”—And from\\nher great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton\\nfor being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of\\nresentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now\\ngraciously overcome.—After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it\\nbeyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\\n\\n“Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\\nanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\\nis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\\nhere, and pay his respects to you.”\\n\\n“What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?—That will\\nbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits,\\nand Mr. Elton’s time is so engaged.”\\n\\n“Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.—He really is engaged from morning to\\nnight.—There is no end of people’s coming to him, on some pretence or\\nother.—The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\\nwanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\\nhim.—‘Upon my word, Mr. E.,’ I often say, ‘rather you than I.—I do not\\nknow what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had half\\nso many applicants.’—Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them\\nboth to an unpardonable degree.—I believe I have not played a bar this\\nfortnight.—However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose\\nto wait on you all.” And putting up her hand to screen her words from\\nEmma—“A congratulatory visit, you know.—Oh! yes, quite indispensable.”\\n\\nMiss Bates looked about her, so happily—!\\n\\n“He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from\\nKnightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\\nconsultation.—Mr. E. is Knightley’s right hand.”\\n\\nEmma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “Is Mr. Elton\\ngone on foot to Donwell?—He will have a hot walk.”\\n\\n“Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\\nCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\\nlead.—I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.”\\n\\n“Have not you mistaken the day?” said Emma. “I am almost certain that\\nthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.—Mr. Knightley was at\\nHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.”\\n\\n“Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer, which\\ndenoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton’s side.—“I do\\nbelieve,” she continued, “this is the most troublesome parish that ever\\nwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.”\\n\\n“Your parish there was small,” said Jane.\\n\\n“Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\\ntalked of.”\\n\\n“But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\\nyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;\\nthe only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.”\\n\\n“Ah! you clever creature, that’s very true. What a thinking brain you\\nhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if\\nwe could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would\\nproduce perfection.—Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that\\n_some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.—But hush!—not a\\nword, if you please.”\\n\\nIt seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\\nnot to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\\nThe wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\\nevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\\n\\nMr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\\nsparkling vivacity.\\n\\n“Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!—But\\nyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I\\nshould not stir till my lord and master appeared.—Here have I been\\nsitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\\nobedience—for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?”\\n\\nMr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\\nHis civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and\\nthe walk he had had for nothing.\\n\\n“When I got to Donwell,” said he, “Knightley could not be found. Very\\nodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and\\nthe message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.”\\n\\n“Donwell!” cried his wife.—“My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\\nDonwell!—You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.”\\n\\n“No, no, that’s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\\nto-day on that very account.—Such a dreadful broiling morning!—I went\\nover the fields too—(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\\nit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I\\nam not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\\nhousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.—Very\\nextraordinary!—And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to\\nHartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.—Miss\\nWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!—Can you explain it?”\\n\\nEmma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\\nindeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\\n\\n“I cannot imagine,” said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\\nought to do,) “I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\\nall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\\nbe forgotten!—My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\\nsure he must.—Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;—and his\\nservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\\nto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often\\nobserved, extremely awkward and remiss.—I am sure I would not have such\\na creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.\\nAnd as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.—She\\npromised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.”\\n\\n“I met William Larkins,” continued Mr. Elton, “as I got near the house,\\nand he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\\nbelieve him.—William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\\nwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get\\nthe speech of him. I have nothing to do with William’s wants, but it\\nreally is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley\\nto-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious\\ninconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.”\\n\\nEmma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In all\\nprobability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\\nKnightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\\nMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\\n\\nShe was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\\nattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\\nan opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\\n\\n“It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\\nnot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\\nintroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\\nhave been strictly correct.—I feel that I should certainly have been\\nimpertinent.”\\n\\n“Oh!” cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\\ncomposure—“there would have been no danger. The danger would have been\\nof my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than by\\nexpressing an interest—. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\\ncollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\\ngreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\\nof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\\ndisgusted to such a degree as to—I have not time for half that I could\\nwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\\nmyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately—in short, if your\\ncompassion does not stand my friend—”\\n\\n“Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,” cried Emma warmly, and\\ntaking her hand. “You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\\nmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\\neven—”\\n\\n“You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.—So cold and\\nartificial!—I had always a part to act.—It was a life of deceit!—I know\\nthat I must have disgusted you.”\\n\\n“Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\\nLet us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\\nquickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\\nhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?”\\n\\n“Very.”\\n\\n“And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you—just as\\nI begin to know you.”\\n\\n“Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\\ntill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.”\\n\\n“Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,” replied Emma,\\nsmiling—“but, excuse me, it must be thought of.”\\n\\nThe smile was returned as Jane answered,\\n\\n“You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\\nam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\\nat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\\ndeep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\\nmore to wait for.”\\n\\n“Thank you, thank you.—This is just what I wanted to be assured of.—Oh!\\nif you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\\nopen!—Good-bye, good-bye.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nMrs. Weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\\nsatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\\nknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\\nwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\\nany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of\\nIsabella’s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both\\nfather and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as\\nhe grew older—and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years\\nhence—to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,\\nthe freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and\\nMrs. Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;\\nand it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to\\nteach, should not have their powers in exercise again.\\n\\n“She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she\\ncontinued—“like La Baronne d’Almane on La Comtesse d’Ostalis, in Madame\\nde Genlis’ Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\\nAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”\\n\\n“That is,” replied Mr. Knightley, “she will indulge her even more than\\nshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\\nbe the only difference.”\\n\\n“Poor child!” cried Emma; “at that rate, what will become of her?”\\n\\n“Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in\\ninfancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\\nbitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing\\nall my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me\\nto be severe on them?”\\n\\nEmma laughed, and replied: “But I had the assistance of all your\\nendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt\\nwhether my own sense would have corrected me without it.”\\n\\n“Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor\\ngave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\\nas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\\nright has he to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to\\nfeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\\nyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of\\nthe tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much\\nwithout doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many\\nerrors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at\\nleast.”\\n\\n“I am sure you were of use to me,” cried Emma. “I was very often\\ninfluenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I am\\nvery sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\\nspoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\\nas you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\\nthirteen.”\\n\\n“How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\\nsaucy looks—‘Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\\nmay, or I have Miss Taylor’s leave’—something which, you knew, I did\\nnot approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\\nfeelings instead of one.”\\n\\n“What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches\\nin such affectionate remembrance.”\\n\\n“‘Mr. Knightley.’—You always called me, ‘Mr. Knightley;’ and, from\\nhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal. I want\\nyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.”\\n\\n“I remember once calling you ‘George,’ in one of my amiable fits, about\\nten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\\nyou made no objection, I never did it again.”\\n\\n“And cannot you call me ‘George’ now?”\\n\\n“Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ‘Mr. Knightley.’ I will\\nnot promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\\ncalling you Mr. K.—But I will promise,” she added presently, laughing\\nand blushing—“I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I\\ndo not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in\\nwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.”\\n\\nEmma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\\nservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice\\nwhich would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\\nfollies—her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\\nsubject.—She could not enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned\\nbetween them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not\\nbeing thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to\\ndelicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship\\nwere declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\\ncircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\\nher intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\\nIsabella’s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\\nobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior\\nto the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\\n\\nIsabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\\nexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\\nwhich appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be\\nconsulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear\\nto find Harriet different from what she had known her before.—Isabella,\\nto be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been\\nequal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her.\\nEmma’s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet’s\\nbeing to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least.\\nMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was\\ninvited to remain till they could bring her back.\\n\\n“John does not even mention your friend,” said Mr. Knightley. “Here is\\nhis answer, if you like to see it.”\\n\\nIt was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\\naccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to\\nknow what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that\\nher friend was unmentioned.\\n\\n“John enters like a brother into my happiness,” continued Mr.\\nKnightley, “but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to\\nhave, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from\\nmaking flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\\ncool in her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.”\\n\\n“He writes like a sensible man,” replied Emma, when she had read the\\nletter. “I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\\ngood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\\nwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\\nyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\\nconstruction, I should not have believed him.”\\n\\n“My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means—”\\n\\n“He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,”\\ninterrupted she, with a sort of serious smile—“much less, perhaps, than\\nhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\\nsubject.”\\n\\n“Emma, my dear Emma—”\\n\\n“Oh!” she cried with more thorough gaiety, “if you fancy your brother\\ndoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\\nand hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from\\ndoing _you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the\\nadvantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish\\nI may not sink into ‘poor Emma’ with him at once.—His tender compassion\\ntowards oppressed worth can go no farther.”\\n\\n“Ah!” he cried, “I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\\nas John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\\nto be happy together. I am amused by one part of John’s letter—did you\\nnotice it?—where he says, that my information did not take him wholly\\nby surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of\\nthe kind.”\\n\\n“If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some\\nthoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes—but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\\nfeelings. What has he been judging by?—I am not conscious of any\\ndifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this\\ntime for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I\\nsuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\\nthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\\nas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, ‘Uncle seems\\nalways tired now.’”\\n\\nThe time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\\npersons’ reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse’s visits, Emma having it in view that\\nher gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first\\nto announce it at home, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to\\nher father at last!—She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of\\nMr. Knightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would\\nhave failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to\\ncome at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.—She\\nwas forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it\\na more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\\nShe must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she\\ncould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\\nin a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\\nobtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\\nsince it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and Mr.\\nKnightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\\nconstant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he loved, next\\nto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\\n\\nPoor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\\nhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\\na great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor\\nIsabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about\\nhim affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he\\nmust not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\\ntaking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but\\nshe was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was\\nintroducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the\\nbetter; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier\\nfor having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to\\nthe idea.—Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He would not deny\\nthat he did, she was sure.—Whom did he ever want to consult on business\\nbut Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his\\nletters, who so glad to assist him?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so\\nattached to him?—Would not he like to have him always on the spot?—Yes.\\nThat was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he\\nshould be glad to see him every day;—but they did see him every day as\\nit was.—Why could not they go on as they had done?\\n\\nMr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\\nthe idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To\\nEmma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley’s, whose fond\\npraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\\nused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the\\nassistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\\napprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\\nconsider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled,\\nand, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance\\nof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse’s mind.—It was agreed upon,\\nas what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided\\nassuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\\nfeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\\ntime or other—in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be so very\\nbad if the marriage did take place.\\n\\nMrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the event.—She had been extremely surprized,\\nnever more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\\nsaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\\nurging him to the utmost.—She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\\nto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\\nso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\\nrespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\\nso singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\\nhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\\nbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\\nlong ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\\nwould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\\nKnightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an\\narrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\\nWoodhouse had been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for\\na marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\\nand Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr.\\nWeston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the\\nsubject better than by saying—“Those matters will take care of\\nthemselves; the young people will find a way.” But here there was\\nnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\\nall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the\\nname. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and\\nwithout one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\\n\\nMrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\\nas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing\\ncould increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon\\nhave outgrown its first set of caps.\\n\\nThe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\\nhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\\nfamiliarise the idea to his quickness of mind.—He saw the advantages of\\nthe match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but\\nthe wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\\nwas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\\n\\n“It is to be a secret, I conclude,” said he. “These matters are always\\na secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me\\nbe told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.”\\n\\nHe went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\\npoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\\ndaughter?—he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of\\ncourse, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\\nafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\\nhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon\\nit would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the\\nevening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\\n\\nIn general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him,\\nand others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend\\ntheir all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John\\nKnightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their\\nservants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection\\nraised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.—There, the surprize was\\nnot softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it,\\ncompared with his wife; he only hoped “the young lady’s pride would now\\nbe contented;” and supposed “she had always meant to catch Knightley if\\nshe could;” and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly\\nexclaim, “Rather he than I!”—But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed\\nindeed.—“Poor Knightley! poor fellow!—sad business for him.”—She was\\nextremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\\nqualities.—How could he be so taken in?—Did not think him at all in\\nlove—not in the least.—Poor Knightley!—There would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with him.—How happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.—Poor\\nfellow!—No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh! no;\\nthere would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\\nthing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that she\\nhad abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan, living\\ntogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who had\\ntried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\\nquarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nTime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\\nbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\\nmorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her,\\nwhen Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After\\nthe first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone,\\nbegan with,\\n\\n“I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.”\\n\\n“Good or bad?” said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\\n\\n“I do not know which it ought to be called.”\\n\\n“Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\\nto smile.”\\n\\n“I am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “I am very much afraid,\\nmy dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”\\n\\n“Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\\nor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”\\n\\n“There is one subject,” he replied, “I hope but one, on which we do not\\nthink alike.” He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\\nher face. “Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet\\nSmith.”\\n\\nHer cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,\\nthough she knew not what.\\n\\n“Have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “You have, I\\nbelieve, and know the whole.”\\n\\n“No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.”\\n\\n“You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet\\nSmith marries Robert Martin.”\\n\\nEmma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes,\\nin eager gaze, said, “No, this is impossible!” but her lips were\\nclosed.\\n\\n“It is so, indeed,” continued Mr. Knightley; “I have it from Robert\\nMartin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.”\\n\\nShe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\\n\\n“You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were\\nthe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\\nor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need\\nnot talk much on the subject.”\\n\\n“You mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself.\\n“It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\\ncannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say,\\nthat Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\\nhas even proposed to her again—yet. You only mean, that he intends it.”\\n\\n“I mean that he has done it,” answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\\ndetermined decision, “and been accepted.”\\n\\n“Good God!” she cried.—“Well!”—Then having recourse to her workbasket,\\nin excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\\nfeelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\\nexpressing, she added, “Well, now tell me every thing; make this\\nintelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was\\nmore surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.—How—how\\nhas it been possible?”\\n\\n“It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\\nand I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\\nto John.—He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\\nasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley’s. They\\nwere going to take the two eldest boys to Astley’s. The party was to be\\nour brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert\\ncould not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely\\namused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day—which\\nhe did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\\nopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in\\nvain.—She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\\ndeserving. He came down by yesterday’s coach, and was with me this\\nmorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\\non my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\\nthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer\\nhistory when you see her.—She will give you all the minute particulars,\\nwhich only woman’s language can make interesting.—In our communications\\nwe deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin’s\\nheart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing; and that he did\\nmention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their\\nbox at Astley’s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and\\nlittle John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one\\ntime they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.”\\n\\nHe stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\\nwas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\\nShe must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence\\ndisturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\\n\\n“Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\\nunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\\nsituation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your\\nfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as\\nyou know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\\nyou.—As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in\\nbetter hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\\nsaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William\\nLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.”\\n\\nHe wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\\nto smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,\\n\\n“You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\\nHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\\n_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\\nare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\\ncannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\\nunprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him, much more, than she was before.”\\n\\n“You ought to know your friend best,” replied Mr. Knightley; “but I\\nshould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\\nvery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.”\\n\\nEmma could not help laughing as she answered, “Upon my word, I believe\\nyou know her quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you\\nperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him. I\\ncould suppose she might in time—but can she already?—Did not you\\nmisunderstand him?—You were both talking of other things; of business,\\nshows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of\\nso many subjects, mistake him?—It was not Harriet’s hand that he was\\ncertain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”\\n\\nThe contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\\nRobert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma’s feelings, and so\\nstrong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on\\nHarriet’s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such\\nemphasis, “No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,”\\nthat she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some\\nmeasure, premature. It could not be otherwise.\\n\\n“Do you dare say this?” cried Mr. Knightley. “Do you dare to suppose me\\nso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?—What do\\nyou deserve?”\\n\\n“Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\\nany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\\nyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\\nHarriet now are?”\\n\\n“I am quite sure,” he replied, speaking very distinctly, “that he told\\nme she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\\ndoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\\nit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\\nof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\\nher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be\\ndone, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then,\\nhe said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”\\n\\n“I am perfectly satisfied,” replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\\n“and most sincerely wish them happy.”\\n\\n“You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”\\n\\n“I hope so—for at that time I was a fool.”\\n\\n“And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\\nHarriet’s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and\\nfor Robert Martin’s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as\\nmuch in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have\\noften talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did.\\nSometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of\\npleading poor Martin’s cause, which was never the case; but, from all\\nmy observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\\nwith very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her\\nhappiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.—Much of this,\\nI have no doubt, she may thank you for.”\\n\\n“Me!” cried Emma, shaking her head.—“Ah! poor Harriet!”\\n\\nShe checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\\npraise than she deserved.\\n\\nTheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\\nfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\\nstate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\\ncollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till\\nshe had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,\\nshe could be fit for nothing rational.\\n\\nHer father’s business was to announce James’s being gone out to put the\\nhorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\\nhad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\\n\\nThe joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\\nimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\\nHarriet’s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\\nsecurity.—What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\\nhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her\\nown. Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her\\nhumility and circumspection in future.\\n\\nSerious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\\nresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\\nvery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\\ndoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!\\n\\nNow there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would be a\\npleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\\n\\nHigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\\nreflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\\nsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\\npractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\\nthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready\\nto welcome as a duty.\\n\\nIn the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\\nalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\\nspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being\\nobliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\\ndisappointed.\\n\\nThey arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had\\nthey been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for\\ncoming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\\nblind, of two figures passing near the window.\\n\\n“It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,” said Mrs. Weston. “I was just going to\\ntell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.\\nHe stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend\\nthe day with us.—They are coming in, I hope.”\\n\\nIn half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see\\nhim—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing\\nrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\\nconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\\nsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,\\nthat Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had\\nlong felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with\\nJane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined\\nthe party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer\\na want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for Frank\\nChurchill to draw near her and say,\\n\\n“I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\\nin one of Mrs. Weston’s letters. I hope time has not made you less\\nwilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” cried Emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. I am\\nparticularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy\\nin person.”\\n\\nHe thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\\n\\n“Is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\\n“Better than she ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\\ndoat upon her.”\\n\\nBut his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\\nmentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\\nDixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\\n\\n“I can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”\\n\\n“The shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\\npossible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know, you\\nhad none.”\\n\\n“I never had the smallest, I assure you.”\\n\\n“That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I had—it\\nwould have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things,\\nthey were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.—It\\nwould have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of\\nsecrecy and told you every thing.”\\n\\n“It is not now worth a regret,” said Emma.\\n\\n“I have some hope,” resumed he, “of my uncle’s being persuaded to pay a\\nvisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\\nare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I\\ntrust, till we may carry her northward.—But now, I am at such a\\ndistance from her—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we\\nhave not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?”\\n\\nEmma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\\nthought, he cried,\\n\\n“Ah! by the bye,” then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\\nmoment—“I hope Mr. Knightley is well?” He paused.—She coloured and\\nlaughed.—“I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\\nin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.—I assure you that I\\nhave heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—He is a\\nman whom I cannot presume to praise.”\\n\\nEmma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\\nhis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\\nand his next words were,\\n\\n“Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—and yet\\nwithout being actually fair.—One cannot call her fair. It is a most\\nuncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair—a most\\ndistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.—Just colour\\nenough for beauty.”\\n\\n“I have always admired her complexion,” replied Emma, archly; “but do\\nnot I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\\npale?—When we first began to talk of her.—Have you quite forgotten?”\\n\\n“Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—”\\n\\nBut he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not\\nhelp saying,\\n\\n“I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\\nhad very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I am\\nsure it was a consolation to you.”\\n\\n“Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\\nmiserable wretch!”\\n\\n“Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was\\na source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\\nall in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\\ntruth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\\nsituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.”\\n\\nHe bowed.\\n\\n“If not in our dispositions,” she presently added, with a look of true\\nsensibility, “there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which\\nbids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our\\nown.”\\n\\n“True, true,” he answered, warmly. “No, not true on your side. You can\\nhave no superior, but most true on mine.—She is a complete angel. Look\\nat her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\\nthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.—You will\\nbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\\nuncle means to give her all my aunt’s jewels. They are to be new set. I\\nam resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\\nbeautiful in her dark hair?”\\n\\n“Very beautiful, indeed,” replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that\\nhe gratefully burst out,\\n\\n“How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\\nlooks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\\ncertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.”\\n\\nThe others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\\nof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\\ninfant’s appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\\nbut it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of\\nsending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston\\nhad been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes, however, the\\nchild had been perfectly well again. This was her history; and\\nparticularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her\\nvery much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that\\nshe had not done it. “She should always send for Perry, if the child\\nappeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.\\nShe could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was\\na pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the child\\nseemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been\\nbetter if Perry had seen it.”\\n\\nFrank Churchill caught the name.\\n\\n“Perry!” said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\\nFairfax’s eye. “My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\\nPerry?—Has he been here this morning?—And how does he travel now?—Has\\nhe set up his carriage?”\\n\\nEmma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\\nlaugh, it was evident from Jane’s countenance that she too was really\\nhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\\n\\n“Such an extraordinary dream of mine!” he cried. “I can never think of\\nit without laughing.—She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\\nit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\\nnot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\\nwhich sent me the report, is passing under her eye—that the whole\\nblunder is spread before her—that she can attend to nothing else,\\nthough pretending to listen to the others?”\\n\\nJane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\\nremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\\nsteady voice,\\n\\n“How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They _will_\\nsometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!”\\n\\nHe had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\\nEmma’s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\\nRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\\nfelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\\nregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\\nsensible of Mr. Knightley’s high superiority of character. The\\nhappiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\\nmomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\\nattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\\nunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\\nrecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\\nfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\\nalone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied—unaccountable\\nas it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness.\\n\\nHarriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but\\nhaving once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\\nself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\\nthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\\nfullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend’s\\napprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\\nmeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—Harriet was most\\nhappy to give every particular of the evening at Astley’s, and the\\ndinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\\nBut what did such particulars explain?—The fact was, as Emma could now\\nacknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\\ncontinuing to love her had been irresistible.—Beyond this, it must ever\\nbe unintelligible to Emma.\\n\\nThe event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\\nreason for thinking so.—Harriet’s parentage became known. She proved to\\nbe the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\\ncomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\\nhave always wished for concealment.—Such was the blood of gentility\\nwhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be\\nas untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a\\nconnexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley—or for the\\nChurchills—or even for Mr. Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached\\nby nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\\n\\nNo objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated\\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet’s\\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\\nimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\\nand who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and\\noccupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\\ntemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\\nand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\\nworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\\nman;—or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\\n\\nHarriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\\nwas less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.—The\\nintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\\ninto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and\\nmust be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\\nmanner.\\n\\nBefore the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\\nher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\\nno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\\ncould impair.—Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\\nbut as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\\nherself.—Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\\nthe three, were the first to be married.\\n\\nJane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\\ncomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.—The Mr. Churchills\\nwere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\\n\\nThe intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\\nEmma and Mr. Knightley.—They had determined that their marriage ought\\nto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\\nallow them the fortnight’s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\\nthe plan.—John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\\napproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse—how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to\\nconsent?—he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\\ndistant event.\\n\\nWhen first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\\nalmost hopeless.—A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.—He began to\\nthink it was to be, and that he could not prevent it—a very promising\\nstep of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he was not\\nhappy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter’s courage\\nfailed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying\\nhimself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in\\nthe assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were\\nover, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated—she could not\\nproceed.\\n\\nIn this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of Mr. Woodhouse’s mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\\nway.—Mrs. Weston’s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\\nturkeys—evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.—Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\\nWoodhouse’s fears.—He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\\nson-in-law’s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\\nnight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of\\nthe Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of\\nthem protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.—But Mr. John Knightley\\nmust be in London again by the end of the first week in November.\\n\\nThe result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\\nmoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day—and Mr. Elton was called\\non, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\\njoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\\n\\nThe wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\\nno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\\ndetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\\ninferior to her own.—“Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\\nmost pitiful business!—Selina would stare when she heard of it.”—But,\\nin spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\\nthe predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\\nceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\\n\\nFINIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EMMA ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

There is much more difference as\\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\\nnot want them._\\n\\n_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\\nbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\\ncause._\\n\\n_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._\\n\\n_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\\nsuperior to them._\\n\\n_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._\\n\\n_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\\neven in a black one._\\n\\n_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\\nto Addison in others._\\n\\n_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\\nare historically true._\\n\\n_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\\noutside of these four._\\n\\n_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._\\n\\n_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._\\n\\n_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\\ncharm._\\n\\n_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._\\n\\n_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\\nCruscans of this._\\n\\n_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In\\nthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\\nGrant.

I.]\\n\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\n\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n\\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\\ntold me all about it.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\n\\n“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\\n\\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“He came down to see the place”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\\nin the house by the end of next week.”\\n\\n“What is his name?”\\n\\n“Bingley.”\\n\\n“Is he married or single?”\\n\\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n\\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\\n\\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\\n\\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as he comes.”\\n\\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\\nparty.”\\n\\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\\n\\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n\\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.”\\n\\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\\n\\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\\n\\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.”\\n\\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\\n\\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese twenty years at least.”\\n\\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\n\\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\nvisit them.”\\n\\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\\n\\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\\n\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\n\\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\n\\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\\n\\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\\nof her.”\\n\\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\\nnot depend on her serving you.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\n\\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\\nthem ill.”\\n\\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\n\\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\\n\\n“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\\nshe will not know him herself.”\\n\\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\\n\\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”\\n\\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\\nwill take it on myself.”\\n\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\\nnonsense!”\\n\\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\\ngreat books, and make extracts.”\\n\\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\n\\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\\nBingley.”\\n\\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\n\\n“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\n\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\\nwhile.\\n\\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\\nword about it till now.”\\n\\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\\n“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\\nball.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\\n\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\\ndinner.\\n\\n[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “He rode a black horse”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\\nin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\\n\\n“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\\n\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\\n\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\nlittle by starting the idea of his\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “When the Party entered”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\\nhis five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\\n\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\\nfriend.\\n\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\n\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\\nMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\\nfriend to join it.\\n\\n“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\\ndance.”\\n\\n“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\\nwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\nstand up with.”\\n\\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a\\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\\nlife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\\nuncommonly pretty.”\\n\\n“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\\n“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“She is tolerable”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\\n\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\n\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\\nhad a very different story to hear.\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\\n\\n“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”\\n\\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\\nshe admired him.\\n\\n“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\\nwith such perfect good breeding!”\\n\\n“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\\n\\n“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\ndid not expect such a compliment.”\\n\\n“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\nstupider person.”\\n\\n“Dear Lizzy!”\\n\\n“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”\\n\\n“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\\nwhat I think.”\\n\\n“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\\nof the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”\\n\\n“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\nneighbour in her.”\\n\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\\nacquired by trade.\\n\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\npurchase.\\n\\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\\ngiving offence.\\n\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\\nmuch.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\\ncourteous.\\n\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.\\n\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\\n“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”\\n\\n“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\\n\\n“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\nabout Mr. Robinson.”\\n\\n“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\\n\\n“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\\n\\n“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”\\n\\n“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”\\n\\n[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\\n“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\\n\\n“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\\nspoke to.”\\n\\n“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\\nagreeable.”\\n\\n“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”\\n\\n“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”\\n\\n“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\\nif I were you.”\\n\\n“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”\\n\\n“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.”\\n\\n“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\\n\\n“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\\n\\n“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\\n\\n“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.”\\n\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\\nin all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\\nLucas.\\n\\n“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\\n\\n“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\\ndiscover it too.”\\n\\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\\n\\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\\nin love as much as she chooses.”\\n\\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\\nenough to make her understand his character.”\\n\\n“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\\nevenings may do a great deal.”\\n\\n“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\nlife.”\\n\\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\\n\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\nallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\\nto dance with.\\n\\nHe began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\\nassembled.\\n\\n“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”\\n\\n“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\\n\\n“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\\n\\n[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George\\nAllen._]]\\n\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\\nturned to him and said,--\\n\\n“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\\njust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\\nMeryton?”\\n\\n“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\\nenergetic.”\\n\\n“You are severe on us.”\\n\\n“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\\n\\n“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\\nmusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”\\n\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\\nimpatient for display.\\n\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\\ndancing at one end of the room.\\n\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\\n\\n“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\\nrefinements of polished societies.”\\n\\n“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\\n\\nSir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\\n\\n“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”\\n\\n“Never, sir.”\\n\\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\\n\\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\\n\\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\\n\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\n\\n“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”\\n\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\\nher,--\\n\\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\\n\\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\\n“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\\nfor one half hour.”\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\\n“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\\npartner?”\\n\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\\n\\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\\n\\n“I should imagine not.”\\n\\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\\nnoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\\n\\n“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\\nMr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\\n\\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\\n\\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\\njoy?”\\n\\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\\n\\n“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\\n\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “A note for Miss Bennet”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\\n\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.\\n\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\\nthe head-quarters.\\n\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\nan ensign.\\n\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\nBennet coolly observed,--\\n\\n“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\\nI am now convinced.”\\n\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\\nnext morning to London.\\n\\n“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\\n\\n“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\\n\\n“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\\n\\n“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\\nfoolish.”\\n\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\\nshould want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\\nhis regimentals.”\\n\\n“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\\nnote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\\n\\n“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\\n\\n“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\\n     /* NIND “My dear friend, */\\n\\n     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\\n     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\\n     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\\n     Yours ever,\\n\\n“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”\\n\\n“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\\n_that_.”\\n\\n“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”\\n\\n“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\\n\\n“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”\\n\\n“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\\nthey would not offer to send her home.”\\n\\n“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\\n\\n“I had much rather go in the coach.”\\n\\n“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\\n\\n[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]\\n\\n“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\\n\\n“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\\nwill be answered.”\\n\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\\nrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\\nJane certainly could not come back.\\n\\n“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--\\n\\n     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\\n\\n     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\\n\\n“Yours, etc.”\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\\n\\n“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\\ncarriage.”\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\\n\\n“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\nthere.”\\n\\n“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\\n\\n“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\\nhorses?”\\n\\n“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\\n\\n“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\\n\\n“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\ntogether.\\n\\n“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\\nsee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\\n\\nIn Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\nof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\nover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\\nwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.\\n\\nShe was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\nbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\nthinking only of his breakfast.\\n\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\nher.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\\nnothing to do elsewhere.\\n\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\\nat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\\nback a supply of clothes.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The Apothecary came”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“covering a screen”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAt five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\nindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\n\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\n\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\\nthought the same, and added,--\\n\\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\nlooked almost wild.”\\n\\n“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\\n\\n“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\\nhide it not doing its office.”\\n\\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\\nescaped my notice.”\\n\\n“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\\nan exhibition.”\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”\\n\\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\\nBingley.\\n\\n“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\\neyes.”\\n\\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\\n\\n“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\\nchance of it.”\\n\\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton?”\\n\\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\\n\\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\\n\\n“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”\\n\\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\\n\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.\\n\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\\n“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\\n\\n“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\\n\\n“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\\n\\n“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\\n\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers; all that his library afforded.\\n\\n“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever looked into.”\\n\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.\\n\\n“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\\n\\n“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.”\\n\\n“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\\nbooks.”\\n\\n“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.”\\n\\n“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”\\n\\n“I wish it may.”\\n\\n“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”\\n\\n“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\\n\\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\\n\\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\\n\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\nsister, to observe the game.\\n\\n“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\\nshe be as tall as I am?”\\n\\n“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\\nrather taller.”\\n\\n“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\\n\\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”\\n\\n“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\\n\\n“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\\nsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”\\n\\n“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance that are really accomplished.”\\n\\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\\n\\n“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.”\\n\\n“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half deserved.”\\n\\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\\nreading.”\\n\\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\\n\\n“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?”\\n\\n“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\\n\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.\\n\\n“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\\nsex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\\nsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.\\n\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\\nunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\nhowever, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\\npossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nM^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\ninquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\nown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\n\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\nBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\\n“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\na little longer on your kindness.”\\n\\n“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\nsure, will not hear of her removal.”\\n\\n“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\\nremains with us.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\\n“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\ntemper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\\n_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\\nover that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\\nequal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\nhope, though you have but a short lease.”\\n\\n“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\\n\\n“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\\n\\n“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”\\n\\n“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\nthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”\\n\\n“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\\n\\n“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\\n\\n“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\\na studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\\n\\n“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\nleast that advantage.”\\n\\n“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\nunvarying society.”\\n\\n“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them for ever.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\\ncountry neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\ngoing on in the country as in town.”\\n\\nEverybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\nvictory over him, continued her triumph,--\\n\\n“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\\n\\n“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\\nwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\\n\\n“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\ngentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\\nat all.”\\n\\n“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\nmother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\\nyou must acknowledge to be true.”\\n\\n“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\\n\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\nsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n\\n“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\\ngenteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\\nimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”\\n\\n“Did Charlotte dine with you?”\\n\\n“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”\\n\\n“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\\n\\n“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\\nbrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my\\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\\nBut, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”\\n\\n“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”\\n\\n“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.\\n\\n“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”\\n\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\\nindeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\n\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\\nown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\\nball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\\nto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\\n\\n“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”\\n\\nLydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\\nwait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\\nadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\nall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\\n\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\\n\\n“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\\n\\nHe made no answer.\\n\\n“You write uncommonly fast.”\\n\\n“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\\n\\n“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”\\n\\n“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”\\n\\n“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\\n\\n“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\\n\\n“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\\npens remarkably well.”\\n\\n“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”\\n\\n“How can you contrive to write so even?”\\n\\nHe was silent.\\n\\n“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\\nGrantley’s.”\\n\\n“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\\npresent I have not room to do them justice.”\\n\\n“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\n“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\\nto determine.”\\n\\n“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\\nease cannot write ill.”\\n\\n“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\\nbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much\\nfor words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\\n\\n“My style of writing is very different from yours.”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way\\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”\\n\\n“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”\\n\\n“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”\\n\\n“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\nindirect boast.”\\n\\n“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”\\n\\n“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”\\n\\n“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”\\n\\n“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay\\ntill next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not\\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.”\\n\\n“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did\\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\\nmore than he did himself.”\\n\\n“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my\\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\\ncircumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\\ncould.”\\n\\n“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\\n\\n“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for\\nhimself.”\\n\\n“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\\none argument in favour of its propriety.”\\n\\n“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.”\\n\\n“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.”\\n\\n“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\\n\\n“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?”\\n\\n“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\\nforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\nknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\\nwhen he has nothing to do.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\\n\\n“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\\nand want to silence this.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\\n\\n“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\nfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\\nthe pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\\nway, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\nseated herself.\\n\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\nadmiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\\nhe disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\\nmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\nhim too little to care for his approbation.\\n\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\nElizabeth, said to her,--\\n\\n“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\nopportunity of dancing a reel?”\\n\\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\nsurprise at her silence.\\n\\n“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\\nyou that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\\ndare.”\\n\\n“Indeed I do not dare.”\\n\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\nbelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\nshould be in some danger.\\n\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great\\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\\n“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\\nnext day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\nand if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after\\nthe officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\nwhich your lady possesses.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “No, no; stay where you are”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\\n\\n“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed\\nin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\\njudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\\nlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it\\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”\\n\\n“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\ncopied.”\\n\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\nElizabeth herself.\\n\\n“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some\\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\\n“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without\\ntelling us that you were coming out.”\\n\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\\nand immediately said,--\\n\\n“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\navenue.”\\n\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\nlaughingly answered,--\\n\\n“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to\\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\nfourth. Good-bye.”\\n\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of\\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Piling up the fire”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\\nseeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\\nwhere she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\\npleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\\nduring the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\\nof conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\\nwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\n\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\\nMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\nhimself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\\nand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\\nattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\\ndoor. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\\nElizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\ndelight.\\n\\nWhen tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\\nsilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\\nHurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\\nsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\\nBennet.\\n\\nMiss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\\nperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\nquestion and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\nan excellent library.”\\n\\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\ntowards him and said,--\\n\\n“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\npleasure.”\\n\\n“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\\nchooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\nthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\\nround my cards.”\\n\\n“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\\nday.”\\n\\n“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\\nnear so much like a ball.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\\ndesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\\nturning to Elizabeth, said,--\\n\\n“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\nlong in one attitude.”\\n\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\ninterfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\nmeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\\n\\n“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\\nsevere on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\\nnothing about it.”\\n\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\nanything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\\ntwo motives.\\n\\n“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\\nas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\\nthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\\ncompletely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\\nas I sit by the fire.”\\n\\n“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\\n\\n“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\\n\\n“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\\nyet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\\nno; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\\nDarcy may hug himself.”\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\\nlaugh.”\\n\\n“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\\nwisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\\nbe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\\njoke.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\\nnot one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\\nand nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\\nlaugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\\nyou are without.”\\n\\n“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\nunderstanding to ridicule.”\\n\\n“Such as vanity and pride.”\\n\\n“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”\\n\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\\n“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\\n“and pray what is the result?”\\n\\n“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\nhimself without disguise.”\\n\\n“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\\never.”\\n\\n“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\\n\\n“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\\n\\n“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\\n\\n“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\nconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\\nwaking Mr. Hurst.”\\n\\nHer sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\\nnext morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\\nthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\\nwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive\\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\nleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\\nwell. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\\ncontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\\nJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\n\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\\nshe felt herself to be right.\\n\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\\nBingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\\nwisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\\nshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\n\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\\nall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.\\n\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\\nanimation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\\nElizabeth.\\n\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human\\nnature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of\\nthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\\nfor them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said\\nin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\\nhad dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it\\nhad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\nbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\\nbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”\\n\\n“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\\nunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners\\nare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”\\n\\n“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\\nBingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly\\nthing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.\\nBut--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got\\nto-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this\\nmoment.”\\n\\n“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I\\nnever saw in the whole course of my life.”\\n\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\\neagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.\\n\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\nexplained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a\\nfortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,\\nand requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\npleases.”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\\nPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\\nin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\\nchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\\nto do something or other about it.”\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\nThey had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.\\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\\n“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little\\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”\\n\\n“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of\\nhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\\nfriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father\\ndid before him?”\\n\\n“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\\nhead, as you will hear.”\\n\\n     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */\\n\\n“Dear Sir,\\n\\n     “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\\n     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the\\n     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the\\n     breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,\\n     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be\\n     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be\\n     at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now\\n     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,\\n     I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of\\n     the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis\\n     de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the\\n     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest\\n     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\n     Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies\\n     which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,\\n     moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing\\n     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on\\n     these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of\\n     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my\\n     being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly\\n     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered\\n     olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the\\n     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to\\n     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make\\n     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should\\n     have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself\\n     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\n     November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your\\n     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do\\n     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting\\n     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other\\n     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,\\n     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your\\n     well-wisher and friend,\\n\\n“WILLIAM COLLINS.”\\n\\n“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”\\nsaid Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most\\nconscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will\\nprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\\nindulgent as to let him come to us again.”\\n\\n“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if\\nhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\\ndiscourage him.”\\n\\n“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean\\nto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\\ncredit.”\\n\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady\\nCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\\n“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There\\nis something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by\\napologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would\\nhelp it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”\\n\\n“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\\nreverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\\nletter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”\\n\\n“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem\\ndefective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\\nthink it is well expressed.”\\n\\nTo Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any\\ndegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\\ncome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\\nastonished her husband and daughters.\\n\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\npoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need\\nof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,\\nheavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This\\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\\nBennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--\\n\\n“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\\noddly.”\\n\\n“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\\n\\n“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,\\nI know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.”\\n\\n“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\\nforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\\nprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,\\nwhen we are better acquainted----”\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\nother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\\nhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a\\nquarter of an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\\nto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\\napprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\npeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\\ntwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.\\n\\n“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”\\n\\n“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\\nfrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”\\n\\n“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”\\n\\n“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\nextensive property.”\\n\\n“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”\\n\\n“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\\naccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\\n\\n“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\ncourt.”\\n\\n“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\\nthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\npay.”\\n\\n“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?”\\n\\n“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\\nas he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\\nin his pleasure.\\n\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,\\nglad to invite him\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Protested\\nthat he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94\\n]\\n\\nto read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\\nwas produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be\\nfrom a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,\\nprotested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\\nexclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\\nchose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and\\nbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\\ninterrupted him with,--\\n\\n“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away\\nRichard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”\\n\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--\\n\\n“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\\nme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”\\n\\nThen, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\\nBennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\nfor backgammon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\nhad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful\\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good\\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\n\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s\\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\npart.\\n\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\\nof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to\\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\\n_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to\\nhint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”\\n\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.\\n\\nLydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\\ngo.\\n\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\\nwere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\\na shop window, could recall them.\\n\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\\nMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\\nhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\\nto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\\nsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\\npavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\\nWhat could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\n\\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\nMr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\\nPhilips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\\ninvitation.\\n\\nMrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\\nappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\\ndisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.\\n\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\\nbehaviour than her sister.\\n\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\\nPhilips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAs no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\\naunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\\nthe house.\\n\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\nwith the housekeeper’s room.\\n\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\\nThe gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The officers of the ----shire”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\\nskill of the speaker.\\n\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.\\n\\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\\n\\n“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\n\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\\n\\n“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\ndrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\\n“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\ndisagreeable.”\\n\\n“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”\\n\\n“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\\n\\n“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\\n\\n“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\nill-tempered man.”\\n\\nWickham only shook his head.\\n\\n“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.”\\n\\n“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\nmemory of his father.”\\n\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\n\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\n\\n“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\nwere speaking of just now.”\\n\\n“Indeed!”\\n\\n“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\nelsewhere.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”\\n\\n“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”\\n\\n“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\\n\\n“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\\n\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\never as he expressed them.\\n\\n“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”\\n\\n“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\nof preference which was often given me.”\\n\\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis!”\\n\\nAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\\nmust be dreadful.”\\n\\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\\nhardly be just to him.”\\n\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\\nmanner.”\\n\\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\\nappears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”\\n\\n“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.”\\n\\n“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.”\\n\\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\\n\\n“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\\nfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”\\n\\n“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”\\n\\nHe shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\neducation.”\\n\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\\n\\n“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\\nknow Mr. Bingley?”\\n\\n“Not at all.”\\n\\n“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.”\\n\\n“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\\nnever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\\nsomething for fortune and figure.”\\n\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\\nmake herself uneasy.\\n\\n“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\nlittle matters.”\\n\\nMr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.\\n\\n“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\\n\\n“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”\\n\\n“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\nyesterday.”\\n\\n“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”\\n\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\nself-destined to another.\\n\\n“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\\nLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\\nher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\\n\\n“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\\nnot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\\nthe first class.”\\n\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\\nMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “delighted to see their dear friend again”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.\\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\nBingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the\\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\\ndone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\notherwise explained.\\n\\n“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\\nother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\nwithout actual blame on either side.”\\n\\n“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\nbusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\nsomebody.”\\n\\n“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\\nmanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”\\n\\n“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\\nMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\\nnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\\nso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”\\n\\n“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\\nthink.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”\\n\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\\nthe affair became public.\\n\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.\\n\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\\nhad no disinclination for it.\\n\\n“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\neverybody.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\ndance.\\n\\n“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.”\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\\nsmile,--\\n\\n“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”\\n\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\n\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\nspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\\nrelease from him was ecstasy.\\n\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.\\n\\n“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\\n\\n“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\nevil.”\\n\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\\nwith--\\n\\n“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\\nroom, or the number of couples.”\\n\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\\n_now_ we may be silent.”\\n\\n“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\\n\\n“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”\\n\\n“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”\\n\\n“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\\n\\n“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“I must not decide on my own performance.”\\n\\nHe made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”\\n\\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said,--\\n\\n“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\\nis less certain.”\\n\\n“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.”\\n\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\\nhis dancing and his partner.\\n\\n“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Such very superior dancing is not\\noften seen.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--\\n\\n“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\\nof.”\\n\\n“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\\n\\n“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\\n\\n“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.”\\n\\n“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”\\n\\n“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.”\\n\\n“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.\\n\\n“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_?”\\n\\n“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\\n\\n“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\\n\\n“I hope not.”\\n\\n“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”\\n\\n“May I ask to what these questions tend?”\\n\\n“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”\\n\\n“And what is your success?”\\n\\nShe shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\\n\\n“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\\n\\n“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.”\\n\\n“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\nanother.\\n\\nThey had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--\\n\\n“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\nquestions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\\nother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\\nDarcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\\nmost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\\ndiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”\\n\\n“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\\n\\n“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\\n“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”\\n\\n“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\\nsister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\\nregard.”\\n\\n“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\\n\\n“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\\n\\n“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\\n\\n“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\nhim _conditionally_ only.”\\n\\n“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”\\n\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\nand told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\\nas to make a most important discovery.\\n\\n“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\\n\\n“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\n“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\nassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\\n\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\\nthe determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\\nspeaking, replied thus,--\\n\\n“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\\nsame time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\\ndictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\\nwhat I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\\nyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\\nyourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\\n“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\nunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\\nreplied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\\n“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\\n\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\\nher perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\\nvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\\neven to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\\nsaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\\nlest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\\nshe considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\\none of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\\ntalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\\nelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\\nBingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\\nof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\\na charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\\nwere the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\\ncomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\\ncertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\\nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\\nJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\\nand, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\\nconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\\nnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\\nto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\\noccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\nchance of it.\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\\n“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\\n\\n“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\nso doing.”\\n\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\nsteady gravity.\\n\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\nentreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\nElizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\\nshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\\namongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\\nbegan another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\\nShe looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\nand, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\\n\\n“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\\n\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\\n\\n“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\\nshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\\nconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\\nroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\\nLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\n\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\nsomebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\\nroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\\nto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\\nhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\\nclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\\nproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\\noften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\\nto herself.\\n\\nShe was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\nit.\\n\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\\nmanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\\nhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\\nhow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\\ngo the next day for a short time.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “to assure you in the most animated language”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--\\n\\n“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\ncourse of this morning?”\\n\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet instantly answered,--\\n\\n“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\\nshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\ncalled out,--\\n\\n“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\\ngoing away myself.”\\n\\n“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\\nMr. Collins.”\\n\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\\nsoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--\\n\\n“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\\nmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\\n\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\\nhe continued,--\\n\\n“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\\nvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\\nhave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\\n“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\\nthem.”\\n\\n“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\nhand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\\n\\n“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\nsituation.”\\n\\n“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\\nvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.”\\n\\n“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\\naddressed her,--\\n\\n“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\nfemale character.”\\n\\n“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\nmay convince you of its being one.”\\n\\n“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\\nis unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\nconsideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\\nportion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the\\neffects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\\n\\n“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\\ntruth from her heart.”\\n\\n“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\\ngallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\nbeing acceptable.”\\n\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\n\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\nand could not help saying so.\\n\\n“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\\na very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\\nI will _make_ her know it.”\\n\\n“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she\\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\\nforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\\n\\n“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\\n\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\nhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\nnot have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\\nnot have _her_.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\non her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\\nher communication.\\n\\n“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\\nfinished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\\n\\n“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\\n\\n“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”\\n\\n“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\\nmarrying him.”\\n\\n“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for\\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?”\\n\\nElizabeth replied that it was.\\n\\n“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\\n\\n“I have, sir.”\\n\\n“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\\n\\n“Yes, or I will never see her again.”\\n\\n“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\nif you _do_.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\\n“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\\n\\n“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\npresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.”\\n\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\\nher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\\n\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\ndeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\nher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “they entered the breakfast room”\\n]\\n\\nCharlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,\\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her\\nfamily. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;\\n“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,\\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.”\\n\\nCharlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\\n“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as\\nmay be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she\\ncan have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\nto maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\\nis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\\n\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\\nattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\\nthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--\\n\\n“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\\nlet Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”\\n\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\\nconversation:--\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Collins!”\\n\\n“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\\nFar be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\\ndispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\\ninevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\\nwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\\ntrust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\nhave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\\nfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\\ndaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\\nMy conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\\ndismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\\nby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\\nstiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\\nher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\nespecially to her friend.\\n\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\\nSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\\naunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n\\n“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\\nMr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\\n\\nShe highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full\\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly\\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\\nHis accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the\\ncompliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an\\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\n\\n[Illustration: “Walked back with them”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\\nfrom Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\\nJane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\\njoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\\nhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\\nfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\\nto town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\\nwhat she says.”\\n\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\\nregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\\ndearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\\nreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\\nmeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\\nhigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.\\n\\n“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.\\n\\n“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\\nwhom we shall deprive you.’\\n\\n“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\\nwinter.”\\n\\n“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”\\n\\n“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\\nmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\\nJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\\nthat she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\\nsubject?”\\n\\n“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”\\n\\n“Most willingly.”\\n\\n“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.”\\n\\nJane shook her head.\\n\\n“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”\\n\\n“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\\nherself.”\\n\\n“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\\n\\n“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?”\\n\\n“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\\nby all means, to refuse him.”\\n\\n“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.”\\n\\n“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\\nyour situation with much compassion.”\\n\\n“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months.”\\n\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of everyone.\\n\\nShe represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.\\n\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\\ncare to have two full courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\\nhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”\\n\\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\nhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\n\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\nthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\nestablishment were gained.\\n\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\nexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\\ninterest than the matter had ever\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “So much love and eloquence”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nexcited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\\nSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\\nexpedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\\nJames’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\\nfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\\nprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\nquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\npublish his prosperous love.\\n\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\\nthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\\nmoved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\\ncordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\\nwhenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\\n“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\npossible.”\\n\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\nso speedy a return, immediately said,--\\n\\n“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\noffending your patroness.”\\n\\n“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”\\n\\n“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”\\n\\n“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\\nthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\\nnow take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”\\n\\nWith proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\nsurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\n\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\\nas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\nshe could not help crying out,--\\n\\n“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”\\n\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\nstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\nher composure, and calmly replied,--\\n\\n“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”\\n\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\\nfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\\nwished her all imaginable happiness.\\n\\n“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\nentering the marriage state.”\\n\\nElizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\\nlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\\nherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\\nshe had chosen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,\\nwhen Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to\\nannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always\\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\\n\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\nmost forbearing courtesy.\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\nor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\\ncould at all forgive their daughter.\\n\\nMr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\\nmore foolish than his daughter!\\n\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\\nto spread at Meryton.\\n\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\\nMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\\nthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\\nenough to drive happiness away.\\n\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.\\n\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\\ntwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\\ndischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\\nwith many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\\naffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\\nthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\\nLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\\nfor Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\\nshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\\nbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\\nday for making him the happiest of men.\\n\\nMr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\\nabsence.\\n\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\\nfalsehood.\\n\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\\nwas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\\nfrequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\\nthe strength of his attachment.\\n\\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\\npainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\\nconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\\ndid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\\nJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\ntranquillity.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\\nand, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”\\n]\\n\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\nand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\\n“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\\nto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”\\n\\n“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”\\n\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.\\n\\n“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”\\n\\n“What should not you mind?”\\n\\n“I should not mind anything at all.”\\n\\n“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\ninsensibility.”\\n\\n“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\\ndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”\\n\\n“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMiss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\\nthe country.\\n\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\\n\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\\nfor her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\\nthe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\\nwhether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\n\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a\\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\\nnot help saying,--\\n\\n“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no\\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\\nall be as we were before.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\nacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”\\n\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.”\\n\\n“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness\\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\\ndeserve.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.\\n\\n“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\\nor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\\nthe other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\\nis unaccountable!”\\n\\n“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\\nsituation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and\\nCharlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\\nready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\\nregard and esteem for our cousin.”\\n\\n“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\\ndanger security for happiness.”\\n\\n“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied\\nJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\\nit does.”\\n\\n“And men take care that they should.”\\n\\n“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”\\n\\n“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”\\nsaid Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\\nunhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\\nwant of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,\\nwill do the business.”\\n\\n“And do you impute it to either of those?”\\n\\n“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I\\nthink of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”\\n\\n“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\\n\\n“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\\n\\n“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\\nsecure it.”\\n\\n“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\\nhappiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\\nconnections, and pride.”\\n\\n“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;\\n“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\\nthey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think\\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s\\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\\nmore; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\\nwith less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\\ncomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\\nto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\\nthen. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\\nbe your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\\nall expect Jane’s good fortune.”\\n\\n“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\\nalways make the most of it.”\\n\\nMr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\\nhad known anything of the matter.\\n\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\\nextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\\nHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.\\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\\nSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\\nside by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to\\nhope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day\\nwould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave\\nof his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished\\nhis fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\\nanother letter of thanks.\\n\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her\\nbrother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at\\nLongbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\\nsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\\nladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by\\ntrade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\\nthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\nwoman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two\\neldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.\\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\\n\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\\ndone, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\\nMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\\nhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\\ngirls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing\\nin it.\\n\\n“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.\\nBingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think\\nthat she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it\\nbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\\nand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\\na daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as\\nmuch entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,\\nsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\\nthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\\nso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\nbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of\\nlong sleeves.”\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in\\nthe course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her\\nsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\\nconversation.\\n\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\\n“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I\\nam sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,\\nsuch as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\\ngirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\\nforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Offended two or three young ladies”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not\\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\\nlove with only a few days before.”\\n\\n“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\\noften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\\nMr. Bingley’s love?”\\n\\n“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\\noffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\\nspoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be\\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\\nbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\\nservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\\nanything.”\\n\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\\nof her sister’s ready acquiescence.\\n\\n“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to\\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\\nunless he really comes to see her.”\\n\\n“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\\npart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\\nperhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\\nwould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\\nnever stirs without him.”\\n\\n“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”\\n\\n“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\\n\\nBut, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being\\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s\\nattractions.\\n\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\\nBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she\\nhoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she\\nmight occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\\nseeing him.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,\\nthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\\nengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\\nof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\\ndinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\\nmade part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\\non these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s\\nwarm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\\nthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\\nof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she\\nresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\\nHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\\nan attachment.\\n\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\nunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\\nbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part\\nof Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\\nacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since\\nthe death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power\\nto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been\\nin the way of procuring.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\ncharacter perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible\\nsubject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with\\nthe minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her\\ntribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was\\ndelighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the\\npresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of\\nthat gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might\\nagree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having\\nheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,\\nill-natured boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Will you come and see me?”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on\\nthe first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after\\nhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--\\n\\n“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you\\nare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\\nopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\\nyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\\nfortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\\n_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\\n\\n“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\\n\\n“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\\n\\n“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\\ncan prevent it.”\\n\\n“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\\nof it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does\\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\\nsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\\nseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\\nof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\\nit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is\\nnot to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\\nfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\\nshort, I will do my best.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\\noften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”\\n\\n“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very\\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the\\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\\nare satisfied.”\\n\\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for\\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice\\nbeing given on such a point without being resented.\\n\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\\nby the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the\\nLucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His\\nmarriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned\\nas to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured\\ntone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the\\nwedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and\\nwhen she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\\naccompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,\\nCharlotte said,--\\n\\n“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\\n\\n“_That_ you certainly shall.”\\n\\n“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”\\n\\n“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\\n\\n“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\\ncome to Hunsford.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\\nvisit.\\n\\n“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and\\nI hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be\\nas welcome to me as either of them.”\\n\\nThe wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\\nthe church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the\\nsubject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their\\ncorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it\\nshould be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\\naddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;\\nand, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\\nsake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters\\nwere received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\\nlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\\nbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\\nexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\\nwrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\\nwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most\\nfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and\\nRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\nfor her own visit there, to know the rest.\\n\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their\\nsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\\nwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\\ngenerally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or\\nhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\\nher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\\nlost.\\n\\n“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the\\ntown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”\\n\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\\n“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very\\nglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\\nto London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.\\nI inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\\nengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\\nsoon see them here.”\\n\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.\\n\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\\nblind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet\\nmore, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself\\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\\nwill prove what she felt:--\\n\\n     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\n     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have\\n     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my\\n     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\\n     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\\n     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\\n     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\\n     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she\\n     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she\\n     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\\n     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\\n     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\\n     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\\n     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\\n     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\\n     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\\n     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all\\n     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\\n     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\\n     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\\n     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\\n     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful\\n     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\\n     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear\\n     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never\\n     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\n     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely\\n     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at\\n     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am\\n     sure you will be very comfortable there.\\n\\n“Yours, etc.”\\n\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she\\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\\neven wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every\\nreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\\nDarcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly\\nregret what he had thrown away.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had\\nsuch to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\\nherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\\nhe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\\nsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\\nwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\\npermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\nremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\\nagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\\nin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to\\nsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\\nready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\\nsincerely wish him happy.\\n\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the\\ncircumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,\\nthat I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that\\npure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,\\nand wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\\ntowards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\\nout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think\\nher a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\\nwatchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love\\nwith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\\nhis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways\\nof the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\\nhandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the\\nplain.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “On the Stairs”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\\ndiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\\nsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\\nElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\\ngoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the\\nplan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater\\npleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire\\nof seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.\\nThere was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\\nwas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give\\nher a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\\nbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\\nand was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was\\nto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\\nspending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as\\nperfect as plan could be.\\n\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\\nand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\\ntold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\n\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\\nhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\\nElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\\nfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\\nof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\\nopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\\nwas a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to\\nhim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,\\nwhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\\nand pleasing.\\n\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think\\nhim less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\\ngood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\\nthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\\ndelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\\nshe had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\\nthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\\nworn out, like his information.\\n\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\\nas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s\\ndoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when\\nthey entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\\nlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\\nlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\\nwhose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\\nwait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\\nfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\nkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\\nshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her\\nsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\\nher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\\nspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\\nhope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\\n“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I\\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\\n\\n“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\\nmercenary.”\\n\\n“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\\nwhat to think.”\\n\\n“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”\\n\\n“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death\\nmade her mistress of this fortune?”\\n\\n“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\\npoor?”\\n\\n“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so\\nsoon after this event.”\\n\\n“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\\nwhy should _we_?”\\n\\n“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”\\n\\n“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\\n\\n“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”\\n\\n“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow\\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\\nneither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\\nworth knowing, after all.”\\n\\n“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”\\n\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\\n“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\\nGardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”\\n\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\nacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear\\naunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me\\nfresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men\\nto rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And\\nwhen we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where\\nwe have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,\\nand rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when\\nwe attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling\\nabout its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less\\ninsupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “At the door”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nEvery object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\\nElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\\nseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\\nand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\\n\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\\nsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\\nThe paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\\nsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\\nroad, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,\\neverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\\nappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which\\nled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\\nthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\\nat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\\nliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\\ncoming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\\ninstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:\\nhis formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\\nfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\\nneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\\nin the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\\nformality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\\noffers of refreshment.\\n\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\\nfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\\nand its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\\nwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\\neverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\\nby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\\nthat she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\\nCollins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\\nwhich certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\\nCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\\nevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\\nfender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\\nhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\\ngarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\\nwhich he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\\nwith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\\nowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\\nthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\\ninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\\nwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\\nfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\\nthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\nthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\\nthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\\nbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\\nhandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\\nbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\\nfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\\ntook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\\nprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\\nhelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\\nwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\\nElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\\nforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\\nCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\\nforgotten.\\n\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\\nwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\\nin, observed,--\\n\\n“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\\nde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\\nbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\\nservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\\ninclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\nwalk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\\n_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\\n\\n“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added\\nCharlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\\n\\n“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\\n\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\\ntelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\\nCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\\npass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\\nwith Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\\nfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\\nconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\\nupstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\\nthe door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with\\nagitation, cried out,--\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “In Conversation with the ladies”\\n\\n[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\\nthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\\nhaste, and come down this moment.”\\n\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;\\nand down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest\\nof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the\\ngarden gate.\\n\\n“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs\\nwere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter!”\\n\\n“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady\\nCatherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\\nother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\\ncreature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”\\n\\n“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\\nWhy does she not come in?”\\n\\n“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\\nwhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.”\\n\\n“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She\\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\\nmake him a very proper wife.”\\n\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was\\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\\nway.\\n\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\\nto dine at Rosings the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     ‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\\nvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\\nwife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of\\ndoing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady\\nCatherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\\n“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by\\nher Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening\\nat Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that\\nit would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\\nWho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine\\nthere (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so\\nimmediately after your arrival?”\\n\\n“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,\\n“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\\nmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\\ninstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”\\n\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\\nvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\\nthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\\nso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\\n\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\\nElizabeth,--\\n\\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\\nCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\\nbecomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\\nwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\\nfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for\\nbeing simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\\npreserved.”\\n\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\\ndoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\\nobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\\nher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,\\nwho had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her\\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\\nto his presentation at St. James’s.\\n\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\\nacross the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\\nElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\\nraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\\nslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\\nhouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\\ncost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\n\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\\nincreasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\\nElizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\\nCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\\nmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\\nthought she could witness without trepidation.\\n\\nFrom the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\\nthe servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\\nher daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\\nwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\\nperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\\nwhich he would have thought necessary.\\n\\nIn spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\\nawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\\nenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\\nand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\\nof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\\nquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\\ncomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\nconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\\nvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\\nsilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\\nmarked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\\nElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\\nbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\\n\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\\nshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\\ndaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\\nbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\\nlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\\nlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\\nthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\\nto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\nher eyes.\\n\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\\nadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\\nand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\\nlooking at in the summer.\\n\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\\nand all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\\nhad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\\nher Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\\nnothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\\nand every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\\nwas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\\nCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\\ngracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\\nto them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\\nto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\\nlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\\nthe dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\\nlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\\nfearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\\nand the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\\ndone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\\nintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\\nsubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\\nher judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\\nconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\\nto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\\nregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\\ncare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\\nbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\\noccasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\\nMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\nElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\\nthe least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\\npretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\\nshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\\nthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\\nhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\nmother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\nquestions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\\nobserved,--\\n\\n“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\\nsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\\noccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\\nnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\\nBennet?”\\n\\n“A little.”\\n\\n“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\ninstrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\\nsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\\n\\n“One of them does.”\\n\\n“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\\nWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\\nyou draw?”\\n\\n“No, not at all.”\\n\\n“What, none of you?”\\n\\n“Not one.”\\n\\n“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\\nshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\\n\\n“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\\n\\n“Has your governess left you?”\\n\\n“We never had any governess.”\\n\\n“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\\nwithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\\nhave been quite a slave to your education.”\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\\nbeen the case.\\n\\n“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\\nhave been neglected.”\\n\\n“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\\nwished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\\nread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\\nidle certainly might.”\\n\\n“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\\nknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\\none. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\\nand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\\nwonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\\nway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\\nit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\\nwas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\\ncalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\\nCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\\nyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, all.”\\n\\n“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\\nyounger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\\nbe very young?”\\n\\n“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\\nin company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\\nyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\\namusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\\nmarry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\\nas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\\nnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\\nfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\\n\\n“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\\nLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\\nand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\\ndared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\\n“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\\nconceal your age.”\\n\\n“I am not one-and-twenty.”\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\\nwere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\\ndown to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\\ntwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\\nparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\\nuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\\nexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\\nhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\nother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\\nof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\\nwas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\\nfor every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\\nSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\\nand noble names.\\n\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\\nthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\\ngratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\\nround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\\nto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\nCollins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\\nsoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\\ncousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\\nfor Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\\nher commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\\nsatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s\\npraise into his own hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long\\nenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,\\nand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\\noften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\\nmornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but\\nwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\\nand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\ncousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast\\nand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in\\nreading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,\\nwhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\\nElizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\\nthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\\npleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\\nreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\nmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and\\nshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\\nwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\\nalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\\nwhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\\nalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\\na few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\nprevailed on to get out.\\n\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\\nout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.\\n\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\\nquarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\\nthem into harmony and plenty.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “he never failed to inform them”\\n]\\n\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\\nof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\\nof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,\\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\\ncomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.\\n\\nIn this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\\naddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\\nimportant. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him\\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\\nby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\\nMiss Lucas and herself.\\n\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\\nin order to have\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The gentlemen accompanied him.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nthe earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\\nturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\\ntwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought\\nwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\\nand, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\\nthe gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\\nhusband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\\nother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--\\n\\n“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”\\n\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\\ncourtesied to him, without saying a word.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\\nway; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--\\n\\n“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\\nhappened to see her there?”\\n\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see\\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\\nsubject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“At Church”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\\nand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of\\ntheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\\nreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the\\nhouse they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\\nalmost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by\\nsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\ncome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\\nof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called\\nat the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had\\nonly seen at church.\\n\\nThe invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined\\nthe party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them\\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\\n\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,\\nmoreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\\nspirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a\\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\\nscruple to call out,--\\n\\n“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”\\n\\n“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid\\na reply.\\n\\n“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\\nlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\\nhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\\n\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.\\n\\n“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\\nCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\\nif she does not practise a great deal.”\\n\\n“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\\nShe practises very constantly.”\\n\\n“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\\nnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\nJenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part\\nof the house.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made\\nno answer.\\n\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s\\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\\nconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--\\n\\n“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\\nme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\\nintimidate me.”\\n\\n“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could\\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\\nare not your own.”\\n\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\\npart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\\nand such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\\n\\n“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.\\n\\n“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\\nFitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”\\n\\n“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\\nfirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\\na ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\\ndances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\\ndances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more\\nthan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\\nyou cannot deny the fact.”\\n\\n“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\\nbeyond my own party.”\\n\\n“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an\\nintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”\\n\\n“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still\\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\\nhimself to strangers?”\\n\\n“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to\\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\\n\\n“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,\\n“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\\nconcerns, as I often see done.”\\n\\n“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the\\nmasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same\\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take\\nthe trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\\nas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”\\n\\nDarcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your\\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\\nto Darcy,--\\n\\n“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have\\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his\\ncousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\\n\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing\\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was\\nready to take them all home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,\\nwhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\\nwhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\\nvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be\\nLady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her\\nhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,\\nwhen the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.\\nDarcy only, entered the room.\\n\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his\\nintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to\\nbe within.\\n\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\\nseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\\ndeparture, she observed,--\\n\\n“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”\\n\\n“Perfectly so, I thank you.”\\n\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\\npause, added,--\\n\\n“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\\nreturning to Netherfield again?”\\n\\n“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\\nvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\\nincreasing.”\\n\\n“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\\nprinciple.”\\n\\n“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as\\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\\n\\nHe took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable\\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\\nCollins first came to Hunsford.”\\n\\n“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\nkindness on a more grateful object.”\\n\\n“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”\\n\\n“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\\ndistance of her own family and friends.”\\n\\n“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\\n\\n“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s\\njourney. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\\n\\n“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\\nof the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins\\nwas settled _near_ her family.”\\n\\n“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”\\n\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--\\n\\n“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\\nthe present distance.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot\\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\\nbeen always at Longbourn.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--\\n\\n“Are you pleased with Kent?”\\n\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_\\nsurprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\\nintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\\nwithout saying much to anybody, went away.\\n\\n[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was\\ngone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\\nhave called on us in this familiar way.”\\n\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\\neven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various\\nconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\\nthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\\nfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\\nwas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be\\nalways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\\npleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\\ntwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\\nalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\\nfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\\nwas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\n\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult\\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\\nFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\\nlove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\\nseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\\n\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would\\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\n\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: “On looking up”]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\\nthat it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\nrencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\\npleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of\\nRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\\na little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\npales opposite the Parsonage.\\n\\nShe was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not\\nwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,\\nshe saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\\nPutting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--\\n\\n“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\\n\\n“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally\\ndo every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\\nAre you going much farther?”\\n\\n“No, I should have turned in a moment.”\\n\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\\ntogether.\\n\\n“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\\n\\n“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\\narranges the business just as he pleases.”\\n\\n“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\\n\\n“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\\ndependence.”\\n\\n“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\\nwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\\n\\n“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\\nwhere they like.”\\n\\n“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\\ndo.”\\n\\n“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\\nmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\\nmoney.”\\n\\n“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is\\nthe usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\\n\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\\nshe soon afterwards said,--\\n\\n“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\\nfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\\nlikes with her.”\\n\\n“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\\n\\n“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\\nyour charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\\na little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\\nmay like to have her own way.”\\n\\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\\n\\n“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\\n\\n“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\\n\\n“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\\n\\n“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\\nin our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\\nto him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\\nthat Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\\n\\n“What is it you mean?”\\n\\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.”\\n\\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\\n\\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\\nparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\\n\\n“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\\n\\n“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\\nlady.”\\n\\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\\n\\n“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\\nonly told me what I have now told you.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\\nwas so thoughtful.\\n\\n“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\\ncousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\\njudge?”\\n\\n“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\\n\\n“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\\nfriend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\\nshe continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\\nthat there was much affection in the case.”\\n\\n“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\\nlessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\\n\\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\\nmatters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\\nas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\\nof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\\npeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\\ncould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\\nsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\\ntaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\\nhad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\\narrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\\n_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\\nin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\\ninflicted.\\n\\n“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\\nFitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\\nhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\\nbusiness in London.\\n\\n“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\\nobjection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\\nexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\\nanything be urged against my father, who, though with some\\npeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\\nand respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\\nof her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\\nnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\nthe want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\\nof sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\\ngoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\\nretaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\n\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\\nheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\\nher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\\ncousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\\nseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\\nas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\\ncould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\\nmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\\nexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\\nbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s\\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\\nkeener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\\nand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\n\\nShe could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his\\ncousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\\nthat he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\\nmean to be unhappy about him.\\n\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\\ndoor-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\\nbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\\nthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But\\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\\nroom. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:--\\n\\n“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\\nyou.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\\nfollowed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\\nheart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\\ndegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\\nto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\\nsuit.\\n\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\\nthe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\\nreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\\nall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\\nhis hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\\nfavourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\\ncountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\\nexasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\\nand she said,--\\n\\n“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\\nfelt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\\nanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\\nof short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\\novercoming it after this explanation.”\\n\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\\nhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\\n\\n“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\\n\\n“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?”\\n\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\\ncontinued,--\\n\\n“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\\nkind.”\\n\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\\n“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\\n\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\\nkinder than towards myself.”\\n\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\\n“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\\nis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\\n\\n“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\\n“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\\ninterest in him?”\\n\\n“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.”\\n\\n“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\\nreduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\\nhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\\nfor him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\\nindependence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\\nall this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\\ncontempt and ridicule.”\\n\\n“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\\n“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\\nthank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\\nwalk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\\nbeing impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\\n\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\\n\\n“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\\ndeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\\nmore gentlemanlike manner.”\\n\\nShe saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\\n\\n“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.”\\n\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\\n\\n“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\\n\\n“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\\nwishes for your health and happiness.”\\n\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\\nthe next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\\nher mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\\nand, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\\nastonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\\nevery review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\\nMr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\\nso much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\\nmust appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\\nincredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\\nan affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\\nof what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\\nwhich he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\\nattempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\\nattachment had for a moment excited.\\n\\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\\nCatherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\\nCharlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Hearing herself called”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\\nwhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\\nsurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\\nshe turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\\nof the gates into the ground.\\n\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\\nwalk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\\nwhich edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\\nMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\\nnow near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\npronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\\nthough in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\\na letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\\ncomposure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\\nmeeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\\nthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\\nout of sight.\\n\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\\nfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\\n\\n“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\\nits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\\noffers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\\ndemand it of your justice.\\n\\n“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\\nfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\\npersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\\nto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\\ntheir motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\\nto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\\noffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\\nbe obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\\nHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\\npreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\\nit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\\napprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\\nin love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\\nyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\\ninformation, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\\na general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\\nevent, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\\nobserved my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\\nthat his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\\nin him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\\ncheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\\nregard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\\nthem by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\\nhere, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\\nsister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\\nby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\\nunreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\\nyour sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\\nwas not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\\nher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\\ninvestigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\\nfears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\\nbelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\\nMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\\nacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\\nin my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\\nmy friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\\nwhich, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\\ninstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\\nimmediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\\nsituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\ncomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\\nuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\\noccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\\nyou. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\\nand your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\\nconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\\nany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\\nyou and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\\ndisposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\ninducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\\nfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\\nNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\\nremember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\\nnow to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\\nwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\\nshortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\\nwent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\\nfriend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\\nearnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\\nhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\\nI hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\\nbelieved her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\\nregard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\\ndependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\\nthat he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\\ngiven, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\\nhaving done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\\naffair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\\nyour sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\\nBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\\nhave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\\ndid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\ndanger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\\ndone, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\\nnothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\\nsister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\\ngoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\\nyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\\naccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\\nlaying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\\nhas _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\\nshall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\\nMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\\nthe management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\\nthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\\nto him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\\nafterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\\nalways poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\\ngive him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\\nyoung man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\\nhighest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\\nintended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\\nsince I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\\nvicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\\nguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\\nobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\\nhad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\\ncould not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\\nonly can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\\ncreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\\nhis real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\\ndied about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\\nlast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\\npromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\\nallow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\\none thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\\nwithin half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\\nthat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\\nnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\nbenefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\\nmust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\\ninsufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\\nsincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\\nproposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\\nbusiness was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\\nchiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\\nnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\\ndissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\\ndecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\\nhe applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\\ncircumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\\nwere exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\\nand was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\\nhim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\\ndoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\\nhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\\nresisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\\nthe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\\nhis abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\\nperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\\nknow not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\\nnotice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\\nmyself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\\nto unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\\nyour secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\\nto the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\\nmyself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\\nestablishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\\nthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\\nWickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\\nacquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\\nmost unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\\nrecommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\\nstrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\\npersuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\\nwas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\\nherself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\\nelopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\\nand offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\\nacted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\\nexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\\nand Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\\nchief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\\nthousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\\ncomplete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\\ntowards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\\nfalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\\nwondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\\neither. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\\nnot in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\\ntold you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\\nwhat could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\\nFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\\nstill more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\\nunavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\\nyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\\nthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\\nto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\ncourse of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n\\n“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\\ncontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\\nits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\\nshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to\\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\\nhardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s\\ninsensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the\\nreal, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\\nwish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\\nwhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\\npride and insolence.\\n\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\\nshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\\nto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\\nThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had\\ngone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\\nlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\nregard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\\nwas unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly\\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\\nown words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\\nthe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\\nwas fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\\nother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\\nnot err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\\nBut every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\\nrender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\n\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\\nMr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\\nentrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\\npersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Meeting accidentally in Town”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nhimself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\\nshe had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and\\nmanner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\\nfor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\\nMr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\\ncontinuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\\ninstantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\\nremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\\nneighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\\nthe mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\\nmore continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\\nbetween Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at\\nlast she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\\nFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\\ninformation of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose\\ncharacter she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\\nresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\\nof the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been\\nwell assured of his cousin’s corroboration.\\n\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\\nbetween Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.\\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\\nthe very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s\\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\\nalways prevent his exposing the son.\\n\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\\nattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\\nand fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\\nof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\\nesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\nsister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\\nactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\\nthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\\nas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\\n\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\\nprejudiced, absurd.\\n\\n“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on\\nmy discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\\nvanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\\nhave been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\\nconcerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”\\n\\nFrom herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation\\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\\ngive in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\\nof her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what\\nCharlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\\nof his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\\nfervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\\ncomplacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\\nsensibility.\\n\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\nmentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\\nfor denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\\nthan on hers.\\n\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but\\nit could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\\nJane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\\nhad ever known before.\\n\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\nvariety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and\\nreconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so\\nimportant, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at\\nlength return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing\\ncheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as\\nmust make her unfit for conversation.\\n\\nShe was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\\ncalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\\nleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\\nan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\\ntill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\\nmissing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\\nlonger an object. She could think only of her letter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“His parting obeisance”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having\\nbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\\nable to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very\\ngood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\\nmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\\nhastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,\\nimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\\nhaving them all to dine with her.\\n\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\\nshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her\\nfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\\nLadyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how\\nwould she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused\\nherself.\\n\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure\\nyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody\\nfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\\nThey were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\\nColonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\\nseemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His\\nattachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\\n\\nMr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\\nspirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\\n\\n“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\\nmay stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\\ncompany, I am sure.”\\n\\n“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied\\nElizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\\nnext Saturday.”\\n\\n“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\\nspare you for another fortnight.”\\n\\n“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Dawson”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will\\nstay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you\\nas far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and\\nas Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good\\nroom for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be\\ncool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\\nlarge.”\\n\\n“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\noriginal plan.”\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the\\nworld to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\\nDarcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am\\nglad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\\n\\n“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\\n\\n“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\\nhave somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?\\nOh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\\nattended to.”\\n\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;\\nand as she did not answer them all herself attention was\\nnecessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a\\nmind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection\\nmust be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave\\nway to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a\\nsolitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of\\nunpleasant recollections.\\n\\nMr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\\nshe was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly\\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she\\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in\\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,\\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\nirritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\\never.\\n\\nAnxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s\\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to\\nhave been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\\nrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n\\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s\\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\\nseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it\\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\n\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\\nher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\\nthere; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\\ntheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\\nand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\\nway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\\nwork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\n\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\\na good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\\nand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out\\nher hand to both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The elevation of his feelings.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\\nminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\\npaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\\n“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet\\nexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\\ncertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\\nit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know\\nhow little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\\nmanner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we\\nsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\\nand that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending\\nyour time unpleasantly.”\\n\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had\\nspent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\\nCharlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel\\nthe obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling\\nsolemnity replied,--\\n\\n“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\ntime not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\\nfortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior\\nsociety, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of\\nvarying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that\\nyour Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation\\nwith regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of\\nextraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on\\nwhat a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In\\ntruth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this\\nhumble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\\n\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\\nobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\\nand truth in a few short sentences.\\n\\n“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will\\nbe able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\\nhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\\nthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\\nas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\\nthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\\nmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\\nthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\\nother.”\\n\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\\nthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\\nand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\\nhave the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from\\nwhom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such\\nsociety! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently\\nregretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for\\ncompassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,\\nand all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\\nplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\\nparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\\nMr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning\\nher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\\nfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed\\nher in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\\nwhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\nhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“They had forgotten to leave any message”\\n]\\n\\n“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects\\ndelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\\nwhile you have been here.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and\\nthe carriage drove off.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems\\nbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\\nhappened!”\\n\\n“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.\\n\\n“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\\nHow much I shall have to tell!”\\n\\nElizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”\\n\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\\nwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s\\nhouse, where they were to remain a few days.\\n\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\\nspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt\\nhad reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\\nLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\n\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\\nLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know\\nthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\\nJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\\nvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\\nto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision\\nin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,\\nand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\\nrepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister\\nfurther.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “How nicely we are crammed in”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\\ntogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\\nand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was\\nto meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s\\npunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.\\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\\nin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\\ndressing a salad and cucumber.\\n\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\\nout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\\n“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”\\n\\n“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the\\nmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing\\nher purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\\nis very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\\nbetter.”\\n\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\nunconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\\nare going in a fortnight.”\\n\\n“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\\ntake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\\nand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\\ngo, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\\nhave!”\\n\\n“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\\nand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole\\ncampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\\nregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”\\n\\n“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to\\ntable. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about\\na certain person that we all like.”\\n\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\\nneed not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--\\n\\n“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\\nwaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\\nmy news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\\nThere is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She\\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\\n\\n“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\\nimprudent as to fortune.”\\n\\n“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\\n\\n“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\\n\\n“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\\nthree straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\\nthing?”\\n\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\\nwas little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\\nliberal!\\n\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\nordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and\\nLydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\\n\\n“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my\\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now\\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\\nhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\\nget husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\\nhow I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\\n_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend\\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\\nevening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a\\nlady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\\nForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”\\n\\nWith such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\\nassisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.\\n\\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\\n\\n“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\\n\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\\nwhich occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\\ntable, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\\nwas doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\\nfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\\nrather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various\\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\\n\\n“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\\nas we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\\nKitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\\ntreated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\\nwe never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\\nAnd then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\\nloud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\\n\\nTo this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,\\nto depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\\n_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”\\n\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\n\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\\nMeryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\\nthe scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\\nhome half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\\nanother reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\\nagain, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\\n_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond\\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped\\nthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n\\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\\nDarcy and herself.\\n\\nMiss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\\nnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\\nunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.\\n\\n“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly\\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\\ndisappointment.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\\n\\n“Blame you! Oh, no.”\\n\\n“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\\n\\n“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\\n\\n“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\\nnext day.”\\n\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\\nas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\\ncollected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though\\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\\nseek to clear one, without involving the other.\\n\\n“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\\nDarcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\\n\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\\n“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so\\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\\nonly consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\\nwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\\nthing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\\nfeel it so.”\\n\\n“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full\\nof both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\\nevery moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\\nsaving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as\\nlight as a feather.”\\n\\n“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”\\n\\n“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\\nappearance of it.”\\n\\n“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\\nused to do.”\\n\\n“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an\\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing\\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”\\n\\n“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\\nthe matter as you do now.”\\n\\n“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very\\nuncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I\\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,\\nand vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”\\n\\n“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\\nundeserved.”\\n\\n“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\\none point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand\\nWickham’s character.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no\\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”\\n\\n“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to\\nmake his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\\nso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\\nMeryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to\\nit. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to\\nanybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found\\nout, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\\nAt present I will say nothing about it.”\\n\\n“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”\\n\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She\\nhad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\\nfortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\\nmight wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\\nlurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\\nrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister\\nhow sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\\nwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than\\na perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\\nthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be\\nable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\\nhimself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost\\nall its value!”\\n\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\\nstate of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\\nvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in\\nlove before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from\\nher age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often\\nboast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to\\nevery other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those\\nregrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their\\ntranquillity.\\n\\n“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of\\nthis sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\\nof it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I\\ncannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a\\nvery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least\\nchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\\neverybody, too, who is likely to know.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “I am determined never to speak of it again”\\n]\\n\\n“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”\\n\\n“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I\\nshall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was\\nher, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure\\nJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he\\nhas done.”\\n\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she\\nmade no answer.\\n\\n“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\\nCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it\\nwill last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\\nexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,\\nshe is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\\nhousekeeping, I dare say.”\\n\\n“No, nothing at all.”\\n\\n“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will\\ntake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\\nfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\\ntalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it\\nquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”\\n\\n“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\\n\\n“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they\\noften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\\nestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be\\nashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\\nthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\\nthe neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\\n“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they\\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,\\nLizzy?”\\n\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.\\n\\n“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel\\nMiller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”\\n\\n“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.\\n\\n“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”\\n\\n“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”\\n\\n“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”\\nadded Kitty.\\n\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s\\nobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\\ninterference in the views of his friend.\\n\\nBut the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\\nreceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the\\nregiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour\\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\\ntheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\n\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\\nto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew\\nabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s\\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\\n“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”\\nsaid she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\\nright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”\\n\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\\nher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\\nexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\\nconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense\\nfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it\\nknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\\ngo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general\\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\\nsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\\nbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--\\n\\n“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public\\nplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little\\nexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\\ncircumstances.”\\n\\n“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to\\nus all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and\\nimprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\\nwould judge differently in the affair.”\\n\\n“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away\\nsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\\nsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\\nare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows\\nwho have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”\\n\\n“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\\nof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\\nimportance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the\\nwild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\\nLydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\\nfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\\nof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\\nher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\\nwill be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\nthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\\nyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of\\nher mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty\\nis also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\nignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you\\nsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\\ndisgrace?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,\\naffectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--\\n\\n“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,\\nyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\\nadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\\nsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\\nBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\\nkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\\neven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\\nwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\\nthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\nmany degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest\\nof her life.”\\n\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\\ncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\\nin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\\nShe was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over\\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\\ndisposition.\\n\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\\nfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\\nunited volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\\nevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\\nof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\\nShe saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at\\npresent unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\nand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\\nsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\\nofficers at once.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Tenderly flirting”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nHad she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and\\nsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could\\nhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the\\nsame. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the\\nmelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there\\nhimself.\\n\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\\ncontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving\\nhome.\\n\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\\nand her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.\\n\\nOn the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,\\nwith others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\\ndisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three\\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\\n\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s\\nrecollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\\nasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\\nWith an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you\\nsay that he was at Rosings?”\\n\\n“Nearly three weeks.”\\n\\n“And you saw him frequently?”\\n\\n“Yes, almost every day.”\\n\\n“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\\n\\n“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”\\n\\n“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray\\nmay I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in\\naddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\\nordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more\\nserious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”\\n\\n“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much\\nwhat he ever was.”\\n\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\nrejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\\nand anxious attention, while she added,--\\n\\n“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”\\n\\nWickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\\naccents,--\\n\\n“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\\nthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\\njudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\\nhas very much at heart.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\\nmutual desire of never meeting again.\\n\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\\nfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\\nbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\\nonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\\nand impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there\\nwas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous\\nhappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus\\nof her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\nThe arrival of the\\nGardiners\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHad Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\\nnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic\\ncomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\\nof good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\\nwoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\\ntheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\\nimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\\nenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as\\nher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\\nthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\\nwife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\n\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\\nfather’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\n\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little\\nother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\\nabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and\\nsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around\\nthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\\nmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\\ngreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her\\nfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\\nwatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\\nhas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\\nforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\\nname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\\nsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\\nagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\\npresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\\nwas now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\\nfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\\nand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\\nscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\\n“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\\nsister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\\npleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\\nnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\\nthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\\n\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\\nto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\\nalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\\nthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\\nhad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\\nmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\nviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\\ncamp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\\nto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\\ntoo full of lines under the words to be made public.\\n\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\ngood-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\\nwore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\\ncame back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\\nBennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\\nof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\\nwithout tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\\nhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\\nreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\\nsome cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\\nshould be quartered in Meryton.\\n\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\\napproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\\narrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\\ncurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\\nsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\\nwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\\nfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\\nthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\\npresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\\ncounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\\nweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\\ntown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\\nthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\\nher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\n\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\\nthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\\nwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\\nand all was soon right again.\\n\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\\nimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\\nowner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\\nand rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\\n\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\\nbefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\\nMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\\nLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\\nyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\\nsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\\nway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\n\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\\nmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\\nenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\\nsuitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\ninconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\\nand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\\ndisappointments abroad.\\n\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\\nnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\\nlay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\\nsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\\nconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\\nformer residence, and where she had lately learned that some\\nacquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\\nall the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\\nLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\\nwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\\ninclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\nwillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\\n“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\\nmuch?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\\nacquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\\nknow.”\\n\\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\\nmust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\\nshe really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\\nrichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\\ngrounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\\ncountry.”\\n\\nElizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\\noccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\\nthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\\na risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\\nthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\\nabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\\n\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\nwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\\nproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\\nthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\\nto the scheme.\\n\\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Conjecturing as to the date”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\\nPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\\nin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\\nentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\\na beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\n\\nElizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\\nevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\\nhalf a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\\neminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\\nPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\\nthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\nwoody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\\nswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\\nwere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\\nhad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\\nbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\nall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\\nto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\\nwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\\nmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\\nwonder at her being where she was.\\n\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\\nit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\\nto be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\\nsuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\\nadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\\nfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\\nfurniture of Rosings.\\n\\n“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\\nthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\\nherself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\\n\\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\\n\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\\nabsent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\\nreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\\nparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\\nnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\n\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\\nthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\\nminiatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\\nshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\\nhad been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\\narmy,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\\nreturn it.\\n\\n“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\\n“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\\nother--about eight years ago.”\\n\\n“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\\nlooking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\\nus whether it is like or not.”\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\n\\n“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\\n\\nElizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\\n\\n“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\\n\\n“Yes, very handsome.”\\n\\n“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\\nmaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\\nbe then. He was very fond of them.”\\n\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\\nwhen she was only eight years old.\\n\\n“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\\n\\n“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\naccomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\\nnew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\\ncomes here to-morrow with him.”\\n\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\\nfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\\nmaster and his sister.\\n\\n“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\\n\\n“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\\n\\n“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\\n\\n“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\\ngood enough for him.”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\\n\\n“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\\nhim,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\\n“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\\never since he was four years old.”\\n\\nThis was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\\nHer keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\\ngrateful to her uncle for saying,--\\n\\n“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\\nhaving such a master.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\\nmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\\nwas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\\nworld.”\\n\\nElizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\\n\\n“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\\nas affable to the poor.”\\n\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\\nfurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\\n“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\\nlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\\ngive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\\nsaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\\naway like other young men.”\\n\\n“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\\n\\n“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\\n\\n“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\\n\\n“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\\n\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\\nlast at Pemberley.\\n\\n“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\\none of the windows.\\n\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\\nthe room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\\nis nothing he would not do for her.”\\n\\nThe picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\\nDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\\nalso more intelligible.\\n\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\\nwhen he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\\nearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\\ngallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\\nfather’s lifetime.\\n\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\\nconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\\nor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\\nthe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\\nthe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\\nherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\\nthan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\\nits impropriety of expression.\\n\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\\nthey returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\\n\\nAs they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\\nsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.\\n\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\\nof perfect civility.\\n\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\\nreturned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\\nminutes in which they continued together were some of the most\\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\ninquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\\ndistraction of his thoughts.\\n\\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\\nleave.\\n\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\\nfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\\ndiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\\naccount for it.\\n\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\\nto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\\ncomposure.\\n\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\n\\nThey entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\\nascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\\ncircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\\nthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\\nhe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\\nshe began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\\ngot beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\\nrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\\nher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\\nno more.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\\nshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\\nacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\\nrevolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\\nshe, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\\nfashion.”\\n\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\\nconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\\nrelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\\nhis taste, or his good manners.\\n\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\\nwalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\\nwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\\ncompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\\nextreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\\nwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\\nthat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\\nwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\\nme.”\\n\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\\nMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\\nElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\\nher husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\\ntogether. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\nvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\\nthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\\nwill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\\n\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\\nnot very differently engaged.\\n\\n“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\\npause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\\nduring your stay at Lambton?”\\n\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\\nhim think really ill of her.\\n\\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\\nmile behind.\\n\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\\nthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\ngreat perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\\nand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\\n\\nOn Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\\nthe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\\nparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\\nwalking slowly towards the house.\\n\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\\npronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\\n\\n“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\\n\\n“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\\naunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\\n_I_ have seen nothing of it.”\\n\\n“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\\n\\n“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\\nor rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\\nperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\\ndisagreeable?”\\n\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\\nhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\\n“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\\nher uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\\nat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\\nwarn me off his grounds.”\\n\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\\ngood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\\nevery virtue.”\\n\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\\nWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\\nintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\\n\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above\\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,\\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\\narrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the\\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\\ncurricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\\nlivery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\\nto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\\nElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\\nat her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\\ndreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\\nher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\n\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\\n\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\\nher beyond a monosyllable.\\n\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\\nwas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\\n\\nThey had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\\nElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\\ninquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\\nlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\\neach with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from\\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\nit was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\\nevident enough.\\n\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom\\nshe endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.\\nBingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be\\npleased.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “To make herself agreeable to all”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a\\nlike manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No\\nlook appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing\\noccurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On\\nthis point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted\\na recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\\nsaying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He\\nobserved to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and\\nin a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long\\ntime since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could\\nreply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the\\n26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\\ngave them meaning.\\n\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but\\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general\\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\\nremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\\nthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\\nhowever temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the\\ngood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would\\nhave been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,\\nbut to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\\ntheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the\\nchange was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could\\nhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\\ncompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could\\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\\nRosings.\\n\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose\\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\n\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\\non this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\\n\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\\nfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\\nthat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\n\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\\n\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\\nthere was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\\noverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\\nshe esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\\n\\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very\\nday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\\nbreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Engaged by the river”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had\\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\\nwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now\\nbe renewed.\\n\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,\\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\n\\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\\nLondon. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\\ninferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\\n\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\\nof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\\nfeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\\nBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\\nthem round the table.\\n\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\\nregret that he came.\\n\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\\n\\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\\n\\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\\nDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\\nthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\\nfor the welfare of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\n\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\\nMiss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\\nperson, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\\nbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\\ncould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\\namiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\\n“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\\nshould not have known her again.”\\n\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\\nsummer.\\n\\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.”\\n\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,--\\n\\n“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\\na beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\\none time.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\\nwas only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\\n\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\\nboth. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\\nbeginning the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XLVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\\nthe third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\\nit had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\n\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\\nthemselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--\\n\\n“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\\nlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\\nthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\\nknow what I have written.”\\n\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\\n“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\\nwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\\nhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\\nto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\\nno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\\nhackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\\nLondon road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\\ninquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\\nand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\\npass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\\nbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\\nblame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\\nmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\\ncircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\\nprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\\ncould form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\\nwhich is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\\nto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\\nhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\\nis really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\\nbetter, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\\nmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\\nover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\\nhowever, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\\nagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\\nare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\\nsoon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\\nthe former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\\nto try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\\nhis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\\nbest and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\\nagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\\nassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\\n\\n“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\\nimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\\nenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\\nI have not an instant to lose.”\\n\\n“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\\n\\nElizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\\nmistress home instantly.\\n\\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\\n“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”\\n\\n“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by\\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”\\n\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\\nsomething indistinctly of his\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “I have not an instant to lose”\\n]\\n\\nconcern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke\\nagain. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It\\ncannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her\\nfriends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\\nWickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too\\nwell to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that\\ncan tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”\\n\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.\\n\\n“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_\\nmight have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained\\nsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\\nhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\\nall too late now.”\\n\\n“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it\\ncertain, absolutely certain?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\\nalmost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to\\nScotland.”\\n\\n“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”\\n\\n“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s\\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\\nnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”\\n\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n\\n“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what\\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\\n\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\\nwas sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\\nwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up\\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--\\n\\n“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything\\nto plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\\nWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\\nthat might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\\nyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\\nlong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”\\n\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\\nonly one serious parting look, went away.\\n\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\n\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\\nbusiness. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\\nhope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\\nof all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\\nthat Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\\nprey.\\n\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\\nfeel it!\\n\\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\\nimportance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\\nby the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\\nthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\\nbeen a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\\npromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\\nby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\\ndone about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?”\\n\\n“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\\n_That_ is all settled.”\\n\\n“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\\nprepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\\n\\nBut wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\\nGardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “The first pleasing earnest of their welcome”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\\ndrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\\nsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\\nnot adequate to the risk.”\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\\n“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\\nhim capable of it?”\\n\\n“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\\nI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\\ncase?”\\n\\n“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.”\\n\\n“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\\nBarnet road.”\\n\\n“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\\n\\n“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\\nfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\\ndo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\\nsuch a matter.”\\n\\n“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”\\n\\n“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\\ntears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\\na point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\\nflirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\\neverything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\\ngreater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\\nare naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\\n\\n“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\\n\\n“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\\n\\n“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\\n“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\\nsuch forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\nher.”\\n\\n“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\\nand Jane seem so well to understand?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\\nso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\\nignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\\napparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\\nneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\\nconsequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\\nenough from my thoughts.”\\n\\n“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\\n\\n“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\\nthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\\n\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\\nfind no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\n\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\\nthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\\nto Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\\nexpectations.\\n\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\\nfaces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n\\nElizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\\nher mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\\n\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\\nheard of the fugitives.\\n\\n“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\\neverything will be well.”\\n\\n“Is my father in town?”\\n\\n“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\\n\\n“And have you heard from him often?”\\n\\n“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.”\\n\\n“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\\n\\n“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\\nshaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\\nHeaven! are quite well.”\\n\\n“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\\nmust have gone through!”\\n\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\\nthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\n\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\\nhowever, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\\nblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.\\n\\n“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\\nwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\\nhad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\\nbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\\nthe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\\nchild! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\\nto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\\nwe shall do.”\\n\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\\n“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\\nmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\\nlost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\\ntogether as to what is to be done.”\\n\\n“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\\nafter they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\\nheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\\nLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\\nfor she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\\n\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\\nher hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\\n\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\\noccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\\noppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\\ntongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\\nbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\\nmost trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\\nsubject.\\n\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\\nbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\\nfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\\nin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\\nwhich she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more\\nof fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\\nof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--\\n\\n“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\\neach other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\\n\\nThen perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\\n“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\\nlesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one\\nfalse step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less\\nbrittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in\\nher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”\\n\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to\\nmake any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\\nopportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to\\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\\nthe subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I\\nhave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”\\n\\n“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\\nespecially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”\\n\\n“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”\\n\\n“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\\ninclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”\\n\\n“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\\n\\n“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a\\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in\\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\\nbeing in love with each other many weeks.”\\n\\n“But not before they went to Brighton?”\\n\\n“No, I believe not.”\\n\\n“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\\nknow his real character?”\\n\\n“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\\nbut I hope this may be false.”\\n\\n“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\\nthis could not have happened!”\\n\\n“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\\n\\n“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”\\n\\n“We acted with the best intentions.”\\n\\n“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\\nwife?”\\n\\n“He brought it with him for us to see.”\\n\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\\nwere the contents:--\\n\\n     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */\\n\\n     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\n     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\\n     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\\n     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without\\n     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at\\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\\n     surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\\n     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\\n     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my\\n     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\\n     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my\\n     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to\\n     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed\\n     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\\n     drink to our good journey.\\n\\n“Your affectionate friend,\\n\\n“LYDIA BENNET.”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had\\nfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But\\nat least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\\n_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”\\n\\n“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\\nsuch confusion!”\\n\\n“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who\\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\\n\\n“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to\\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\\nas I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen\\nalmost took from me my faculties.”\\n\\n“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\\nupon yourself alone.”\\n\\n“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.\\nKitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of\\nrepose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on\\nTuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady\\nLucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\\nthey could be of use to us.”\\n\\n“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she\\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too\\nlittle of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,\\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”\\n\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\\n“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where\\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could\\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\\ngentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be\\nremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\nout even so much as this.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     The Post\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\\nThey were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to\\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\n\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\\ninformation of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,\\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to\\nthe great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\\nsecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to\\nher nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\\ngreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,\\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\nthem.\\n\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\\nbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.\\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\\nher sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\\ncome, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\\nnews of them.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\\nletter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately\\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.\\nThat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\\ndid not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was\\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.\\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and\\npromised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this\\neffect:--\\n\\n“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\npossible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\\nwhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\\nknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there\\nwere anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such\\na clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any\\nother person.”\\n\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for\\nher authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\\ninformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\\n\\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\\nand mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,\\nhowever, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to\\ngive more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\n\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was\\nthe first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,\\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every\\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\n\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n     /* “My dear Sir, */\\n\\n     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\n     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\n     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\n     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and\\n     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable\\n     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\\n     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\\n     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\\n     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\\n     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The\\n     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\\n     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\\n     of behaviour in your\\n\\n     [Illustration:\\n\\n“To whom I have related the affair”\\n\\n     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\\n     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,\\n     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\\n     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\\n     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in\\n     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by\\n     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\\n     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one\\n     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for\\n     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect\\n     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,\\n     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\\n     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\\n     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,\\n     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\\n     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\n     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\\n\\n“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up\\nany connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His\\nformer acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\\nwith any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out\\nas likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own\\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired\\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be\\nnecessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the\\ntown, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner\\ndid not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;\\nJane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\\nunexpected; I had not an idea of it.”\\n\\nMr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their\\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\\nspiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\\nhis brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and\\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\\n“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he\\nwill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?”\\n\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\\nand her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet\\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\n\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\\nDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.\\nHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of\\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\\nElizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from\\nPemberley.\\n\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\\nfairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time\\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\\nLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\\none sleepless night out of two.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\nphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\\naway; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\\nit.\\n\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\\nand I ought to feel it.”\\n\\n“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\\n\\n“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to\\nfall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\\nIt will pass away soon enough.”\\n\\n“Do you suppose them to be in London?”\\n\\n“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\\n\\n“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\\n\\n“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there\\nwill probably be of some duration.”\\n\\nThen, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no\\nill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,\\nconsidering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”\\n\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s\\ntea.\\n\\n“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an\\nelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\\nI can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”\\n\\n“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\\n\\n“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,\\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and\\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house\\nagain, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely\\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are\\nnever to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten\\nminutes of every day in a rational manner.”\\n\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\\n“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\\ngirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\\nthem.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\\ntogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\\ncoming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their\\nmother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,\\nwhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,\\nmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”\\n\\n“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\\n\\n“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know\\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\\nthis half hour, and master has had a letter.”\\n\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\\nran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\\nlibrary;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\\nseeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the\\nbutler, who said,--\\n\\n“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the\\nlittle copse.”\\n\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,\\nand ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\\npursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\n\\nJane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as\\nElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\\ncame up with him, and eagerly cried out,--\\n\\n“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”\\n\\n“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”\\n\\n“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from\\nhis pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”\\n\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n\\n“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is\\nabout.”\\n\\n     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */\\n\\n“My dear Brother,\\n\\n     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\\n     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after\\n     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what\\n     part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.\\n     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them\\n     both----”\\n\\n     [Illustration:\\n\\n“But perhaps you would like to read it”\\n\\n     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n     “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane: “they are married!”\\n\\n     Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,\\n     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\\n     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\n     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\\n     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\n     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your\\n     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\n     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your\\n     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,\\n     considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\\n     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\\n     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\\n     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s\\n     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\\n     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\\n     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\\n     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\\n     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\\n     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will\\n     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\\n     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\\n     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\\n     my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,\\n     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my\\n     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\\n     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\\n     anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.\\n\\n“EDW. GARDINER.”\\n\\n“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be\\npossible that he will marry her?”\\n\\n“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her\\nsister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\\n\\n“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.\\n\\n“No; but it must be done soon.”\\n\\nMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\\nwrote.\\n\\n“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.”\\n\\n“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\\n\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\\n“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be\\ncomplied with.”\\n\\n“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\\n\\n“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\\nare two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever\\nto pay him.”\\n\\n“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\\n\\n“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight\\na temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\\ngone.”\\n\\n“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me\\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,\\nit must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”\\n\\n“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\\nless than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\\nin the very beginning of our relationship.”\\n\\n“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\nrepaid?”\\n\\nMr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued\\nsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the\\nlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\\n“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\\nwere by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be\\nthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\\nand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”\\n\\n“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would\\nnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\\nuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\\nthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\\nof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\\npounds?”\\n\\n“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said\\nElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\\nnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\\nrequited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\nfirst sees my aunt!”\\n\\n“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said\\nJane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\\nher is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.”\\n\\n“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor\\nI, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”\\n\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\\nit known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly\\nreplied,--\\n\\n“Just as you please.”\\n\\n“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\\n\\n“Take whatever you like, and get away.”\\n\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs\\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,\\nher joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she\\nhad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\\n“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will\\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My\\ngood, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\\neverything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”\\n\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\\nGardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\\n\\n“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great\\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.”\\n\\n“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\\never had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\\n\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,\\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\n\\n“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\\nLady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”\\n\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s\\nsituation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she\\nhad need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,\\nneither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly\\nexpected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only\\ntwo hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The spiteful old ladies”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\\n\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\n\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\\nBennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\\nhusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\nincome.\\n\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\\nthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\\nthat sum.\\n\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\\nas little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\\ndespatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\\nits execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\\nindebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\\nmessage to her.\\n\\nThe good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\\nfarm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\\nin this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\\nwas considered certain.\\n\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\\nher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\\nproper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\nimportance.\\n\\n“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\\ntoo far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\\n\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\\nimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”\\n\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\\nclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\\ntook place.\\n\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\\nspot.\\n\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\\nbut at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\\ndisadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\\nobjection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\\nkind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\\n\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\\nshould meet.\\n\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\\nhave been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\\nthere must be a triumph.\\n\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\n\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\\nfamily.\\n\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\\ncould not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\\na couple who were only brought together because their passions were\\nstronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\\non quitting the militia.\\n\\n“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his\\nmarriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\\nconsidering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\\naccount and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\\nRegulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\\nable and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\\nensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\\nan advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\\nin and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\\npledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\\na list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\\nall will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\nGardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\\nleaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.\\n\\n“E. GARDINER.”\\n\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\\nremoval from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\\nMrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\\nthe north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.\\n\\n“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\\nto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s\\nregiment.”\\n\\nHis daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\nadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,\\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who\\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\\nurged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show\\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to\\nthe north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon\\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth\\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;\\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“With an affectionate smile”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nTheir sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\\nprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\\nthem at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\\nwas dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\\ngave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\\nmust endure.\\n\\nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\\nanxious, uneasy.\\n\\nLydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\\nWickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\\nalacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.\\n\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\\nenough to provoke him.\\n\\nElizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\\nLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\\nlength they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\\nsome little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\\ngreat while since she had been there.\\n\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\\nwere always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\\nhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\\nimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\\ncolour.\\n\\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\\nElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\\nwith a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\\nvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\\nthe world.\\n\\n“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\\nit seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things\\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.”\\n\\nHer father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\\n\\n“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was\\nafraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\\nso I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\\nnext to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\\nwindow frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\\nsmiled like anything.”\\n\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\\nthe dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to\\nher eldest sister,--\\n\\n“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a\\nmarried woman.”\\n\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\\neach of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\\nand boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n\\n“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\\nbreakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\\ncharming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they\\nmay have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the\\nplace to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”\\n\\n“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t\\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\\n\\n“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.\\nYou and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at\\nNewcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I\\nwill take care to get good partners for them all.”\\n\\n“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\\n\\n“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\\nwinter is over.”\\n\\n“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not\\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”\\n\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\\nshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\\nthink than such as did not.\\n\\nWickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to\\nfind it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her\\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather\\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\\nof having a companion.\\n\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did\\neverything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds\\non the first of September than anybody else in the country.\\n\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--\\n\\n“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\\ncurious to hear how it was managed?”\\n\\n“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little\\nsaid on the subject.”\\n\\n“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\\no’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\\nwere to meet us at the church.\\n\\n“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\\nyou know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\\nhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\\ndressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\\nthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\\nhe would be married in his blue coat.\\n\\n“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\\n\\n“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\\ncalled away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\\nfrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\\nand if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\\nout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\\nwell.”\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\\n“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\\nI quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\\n\\n“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\\nask you no questions.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\\nall, and then Wickham would be so angry.”\\n\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\\npower, by running away.\\n\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\\nwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\\nsister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\nLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\nintended.\\n\\n“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\\nspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\\nignorance.”\\n\\n“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the\\nletter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\\nmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\\nout.”\\n\\nJane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of\\nit:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\\nsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“I am sure she did not listen.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\\nsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than\\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\\ncontain a denial.\\n\\n     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */\\n\\n“My dear Niece,\\n\\n     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\n     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\\n     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\\n     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\\n     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\\n     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\\n     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\\n     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing\\n     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\\n     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\\n     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\\n     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\\n     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\\n     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\\n     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\\n     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\\n     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\n     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\n     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\n     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\\n     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\\n     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\\n     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\\n     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\\n     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\\n     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\\n     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\\n     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\\n     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\\n     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\\n     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\\n     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\\n     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\\n     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\\n     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\\n     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\\n     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\\n     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\\n     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\\n     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\\n     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\\n     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\\n     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\\n     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\\n     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\\n     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\\n     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\\n     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\\n     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\\n     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\\n     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\\n     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\\n     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\\n     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\\n     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\\n     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\\n     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\\n     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\\n     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\\n     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\\n     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\\n     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\\n     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\\n     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\\n     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\\n     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\\n     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\\n     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\\n     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\\n     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\\n     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\\n     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\\n     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\\n     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\\n     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\\n     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\\n     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\\n     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\\n     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\\n     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\\n     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\\n     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\\n     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\\n     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\\n     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\\n     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\\n     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\\n     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\n     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\\n     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\\n     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\\n     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\\n     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\\n     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\\n     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\\n     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\\n     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\\n     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\\n     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\\n     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\\n     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\\n     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\\n     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\n     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\n     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\\n     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\\n     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\\n     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\\n     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\\n     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\\n     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\\n     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\\n     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\\n     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\\n     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\\n     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\\n     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\\n     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\\n     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\\n     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\\n     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\\n     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\\n     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\\n     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\\n     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\\n     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\\n     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\\n     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\n     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\\n     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\\n     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\\n     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\\n     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\\n     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He\\n     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\\n     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\\n     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\\n     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\\n     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\\n     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\n     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\\n     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\\n     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\\n     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\\n     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\\n     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\\n     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The\\n     children have been wanting me this half hour.\\n\\n“Yours, very sincerely,\\n\\n“M. GARDINER.”\\n\\n\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\\nin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\\ngreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\\nproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\\nsister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of\\ngoodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\njust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\\nextent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\\non himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\\nresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\\nmust abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\\nmeet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\\nmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\npronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\\nnor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\\nwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\\nthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\\naffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\\nWickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\\nthe connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\\nhow much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\nextraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\\nhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\\nit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\\nshe could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\nmaterially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\\nthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\\nreturn. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\\nhim. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\\nhad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\\nhim! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that\\nin a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\\nof himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\\nagain. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\\nof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\\nboth she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\\nsubsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n\\nShe was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;\\nand, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by\\nWickham.\\n\\n“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,\\nas he joined her.\\n\\n“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow\\nthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”\\n\\n“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,\\nand now we are better.”\\n\\n“True. Are the others coming out?”\\n\\n“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.”\\n\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\\n“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”\\n\\n“Yes, she did.”\\n\\n“And what did she say?”\\n\\n“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\\nmisrepresented.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--\\n\\n“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\\n\\n“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\\nElizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this\\ntime of year.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”\\n\\n“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\\n\\n“And do you like her?”\\n\\n“Very much.”\\n\\n“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”\\n\\n“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\\n\\n“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\\n\\n“I do not recollect that we did.”\\n\\n“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most\\ndelightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in\\nevery respect.”\\n\\n“How should you have liked making sermons?”\\n\\n“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,\\nto be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the\\nretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of\\nhappiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\\ncircumstance when you were in Kent?”\\n\\n“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”\\n\\n“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\\nfirst, you may remember.”\\n\\n“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so\\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\\nhad been compromised accordingly.”\\n\\n“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”\\n\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\\nto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,\\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--\\n\\n“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\\nquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\\nmind.”\\n\\nShe held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy with him.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he\\nnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\\nby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\\nhad said enough to keep him quiet.\\n\\nThe day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was\\nforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\\nentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\\ncontinue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\\n\\n“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\\n\\n“Write to me very often, my dear.”\\n\\n“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\\nwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\\ndo.”\\n\\nMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He\\nsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\\n“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\\nthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us\\nall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\\nhimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\\n\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\\n\\n“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with\\none’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”\\n\\n“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said\\nElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are\\nsingle.”\\n\\n“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;\\nbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If\\nthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”\\n\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\\nrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\\narticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\\nat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\\nmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns.\\n\\n“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.\\nPhilips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that\\nI care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”\\n\\n“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in\\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\\ngoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\\ncolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--\\n\\n“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\\nI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\\nme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\\nalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\\n_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”\\n\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\\nthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\\nwithout it.\\n\\n“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come\\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\\n\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\\n“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you\\nwill wait on him, of course.”\\n\\n“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\\n\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\\nNetherfield.\\n\\n“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let\\nhim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\\nagain.”\\n\\n“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\\non him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\\nam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\\nmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\\nhim.”\\n\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\nhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\\n_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\\n\\n“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\\nbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\\nsays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\\n\\n“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\\nis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\\nof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\\nalways so much.”\\n\\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\\ncontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\\nand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\\nthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\\nseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\\nHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\\npaddock, and ride towards the house.\\n\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\\nto the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\\nagain by her sister.\\n\\n“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\\n\\n“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\\nknow.”\\n\\n“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with\\nhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”\\n\\n“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\\nMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.”\\n\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\\nmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\\nGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\\nhim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\\nand whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.\\n\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a\\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\\nwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.\\n\\n“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early\\nenough for expectation.”\\n\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\\nsister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,\\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her\\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\\n\\nBingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\\nher courtesy and address of his friend.\\n\\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\\napplied.\\n\\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question\\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He\\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\\nit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends\\nwhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\\nthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\\nfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\\nthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\\nthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\\nwith herself for being so.\\n\\n“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”\\n\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\\n\\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\\n“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\\n“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\\nseen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;\\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,\\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a\\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\\n\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\\nnot tell.\\n\\n“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\\ndeserves.”\\n\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.\\n\\n“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,\\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\\nBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\\nmoments of such painful confusion.\\n\\n“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\\none or the other again!”\\n\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\\nhow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former\\nlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\\nfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her\\nas handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\\nunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\\nthat she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\\nthat she did not always know when she was silent.\\n\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\\nintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\\nLongbourn in a few days’ time.\\n\\n“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when\\nyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\\nus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you\\nI was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your\\nengagement.”\\n\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\\nhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\\nthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\\nnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\\non whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\\nof one who had ten thousand a year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Jane happened to look round”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\\nor, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects\\nwhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed\\nher.\\n\\n“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,\\n“did he come at all?”\\n\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\\n“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he\\nwas in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he\\nno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think\\nno more about him.”\\n\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\\nof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her\\nbetter satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.\\n\\n“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\\neasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\\nhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\\nseen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent\\nacquaintance.”\\n\\n“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!\\ntake care.”\\n\\n“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”\\n\\n“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\\nyou as ever.”\\n\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\\nhad revived.\\n\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\\n\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\\nalarm.\\n\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\\nthe family.\\n\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\\n“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for\\never.”\\n\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of\\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--\\n\\n“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\\ndo we?”\\n\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\\nbeing so silly!\\n\\n“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”\\n\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\\n\\n“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\\n\\n“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”\\n\\n“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\\n\\n“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\\nthese three weeks.”\\n\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering\\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n\\nWhen the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\\nmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\\n“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what\\nsay you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I\\nassure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\\nLucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\\nwhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\\nat Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as\\ngood a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved\\ngirls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “M^{rs}. Long and her nieces.”\\n]\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of\\nBingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at\\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\\n“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The\\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\\nmay often meet again.”\\n\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\\n“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\\npleasing, than any other man.”\\n\\n“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and\\nare provoking me to it every moment.”\\n\\n“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\\nothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\nacknowledge?”\\n\\n“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\\nconfidante.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you.”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LV.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\\nfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\\nten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\\n“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\\n\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\\nwould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\\nthem.\\n\\n“Can you come to-morrow?”\\n\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\\naccepted with alacrity.\\n\\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\\ndressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\\n\\n“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\\nLizzy’s hair.”\\n\\n“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\\nforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\\n\\n“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\\nwhere is your sash, my dear?”\\n\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\\nwithout one of her sisters.\\n\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\\nKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\\n\\n“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\\n\\n“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\\n\\n“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\\n“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\\nsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\\nmy dressing-room.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\\ninto the drawing-room.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\\nofficiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\\ndaughter.\\n\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\n\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\\nhappy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\\nconcurrence.\\n\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\\nor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\\neverybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\\nwrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\\nas the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\\nwanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\\n\\nBut on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\\nshe saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\\nmother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\\nperceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\\nif engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\\nthe faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\\nother, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\\n_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\\neither; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\\nBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\\nwhispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\\npleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\\n“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\\nwhy is not everybody as happy?”\\n\\nElizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\\nsaid, for the present.\\n\\n“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\\nfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\\n\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\\ncard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.\\n\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\\n\\n“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\\ncircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\\nhappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\\n\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\\nfather had been short and to the purpose.\\n\\n“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\\n“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\\n\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\nhimself.\\n\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\\nMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\\nhow really happy he was.\\n\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\\nturned to his daughter and said,--\\n\\n“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\\n\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\ngoodness.\\n\\n“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\\nalways exceed your income.”\\n\\n“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\\nunpardonable in _me_.”\\n\\n“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\\nmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\\nhappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\\never was seen!”\\n\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\\nfavourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\\n\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\\nhimself obliged to accept.\\n\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\\nattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\n\\n“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\\nit possible.”\\n\\n“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\\nit?”\\n\\n“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\\ncan never be what we once were to each other.”\\n\\n“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\\n\\n“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\\nwould have prevented his coming down again?”\\n\\n“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\\nmodesty.”\\n\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.\\n\\nElizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\\nof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\\nher against him.\\n\\n“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\\nJane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\\nabove them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\\nanother man for you!”\\n\\n“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\\n\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\\nneighbours in Meryton.\\n\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\\nshrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\\nother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\\nname to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\\nintroduction had been made.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\\nfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\\n\\n“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\nmother?”\\n\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\\n“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”\\n\\n“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\\n“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\\n\\n“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\\nshort silence.\\n\\n“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\\n\\n“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\\nsummer: the windows are full west.”\\n\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\\nadded,--\\n\\n“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\\nMrs. Collins well?”\\n\\n“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\\n\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\\nrefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\\n\\n“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\\nwill favour me with your company.”\\n\\n“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\\n\\nElizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\\nattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\\ndecent-looking rooms, walked on.\\n\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\\nconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\\ndisagreeable.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“After a short survey”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in\\nher face.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\\nmanner:--\\n\\n“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\\ncome.”\\n\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\\n“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\\nfor the honour of seeing you here.”\\n\\n“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to\\nknow that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\\nyou.”\\n\\n“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring\\nwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming\\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”\\n\\n“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”\\n\\n“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth\\ncoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\\nis in existence.”\\n\\n“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\\nreport is spread abroad?”\\n\\n“I never heard that it was.”\\n\\n“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”\\n\\n“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\\n\\n“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\\n\\n“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\\n\\n“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\\nmay have drawn him in.”\\n\\n“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\\n\\n“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\\n\\n“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.”\\n\\n“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”\\n\\n“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\\nmake an offer to me.”\\n\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--\\n\\n“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the\\nunion; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\\naccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of\\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\\nthe family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\\n\\n“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\\nkept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\\nMiss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\\n\\n“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss\\nBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\\nby any of us.”\\n\\n“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.\\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\\nto repine.”\\n\\n“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I\\nbe dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s\\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”\\n\\n“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;\\nbut it will have no effect on _me_.”\\n\\n“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,\\nhonourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on\\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\\nthem?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\nconnections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\\nnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\\n\\n“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are\\nequal.”\\n\\n“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who\\nare your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\\ncondition.”\\n\\n“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does\\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\\n\\n“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”\\n\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\\nmoment’s deliberation,--\\n\\n“I am not.”\\n\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\\n“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”\\n\\n“I will make no promise of the kind.”\\n\\n“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\\nassurance I require.”\\n\\n“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\\nhis cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the\\nsubject.”\\n\\n“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\nobjections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no\\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous\\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\\npatched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\\n_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\\nof his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of\\nwhat are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\\n\\n“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\\n“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\\nthe house.”\\n\\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\\nback. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\\n“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\\n\\n“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”\\n\\n“You are then resolved to have him?”\\n\\n“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”\\n\\n“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”\\n\\n“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\\nthe scorn.”\\n\\n“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\\nshall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\\nreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”\\n\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of\\nthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--\\n\\n“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\\nmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”\\n\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\nLadyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother\\nimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady\\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\\n“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”\\n\\n“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\\nShe is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through\\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\\nnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”\\n\\nElizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to\\nacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “But now it comes out”\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\nElizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\\nhours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\\nLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\\nonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\\nlooked forward to as possible at some future time.\\n\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\\nprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\\napplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\nthat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\n\\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\\n“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\\nfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand\\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\\nat all.”\\n\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\\nbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same\\nkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and\\nElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\\n\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her\\nfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\\n“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”\\n\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell\\nher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\\nconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might\\nbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\\nconsequent explanations.\\n\\nShe followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\\nthen said,--\\n\\n“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\\ncontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”\\n\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\\nherself, when her father continued,--\\n\\n“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the\\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”\\n\\n“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”\\n\\n“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with\\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says\\non that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus\\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\\nher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\\nmay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\\nin this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\\n‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\\nheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\\nextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\\nmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\\nprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,\\nyou will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,\\nLizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for\\ncautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\\neye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\\nhis life! It is admirable!”\\n\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force\\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\\nlittle agreeable to her.\\n\\n“Are you not diverted?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”\\n\\n“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\\nsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\\nher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\\nduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.\\nCollins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad\\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\\na Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\\nChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\\nCharlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\\nLizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\\n_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\\nin our turn?”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\\nstrange!”\\n\\n“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_\\npointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any\\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\\n\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by\\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but\\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of\\nhis seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The efforts of his aunt”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LVIII.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\\nElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\\nwith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s\\nvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\\noutstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\\ndesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.\\n\\nThey walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon\\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\\nmoment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was\\nhigh, she immediately said,--\\n\\n“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving\\nrelief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\\nsister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to\\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\\nof my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”\\n\\n“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\\nand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\\nwas so little to be trusted.”\\n\\n“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\\nsake of discovering them.”\\n\\n“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.\\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\\nonly of _you_.”\\n\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\\nher companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\\naffections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence\\nme on this subject for ever.”\\n\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\\nso material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\\nhappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\\nbeen able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\\nexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\\nthough she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\\nevery moment more valuable.\\n\\nThey walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\\nto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,\\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\\nher nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\\nLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\\n“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that\\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”\\n\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of\\nmy _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\\nyour relations.”\\n\\n“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\\nto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\\n\\n“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\\nevening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\\nexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\\nimproved in civility.”\\n\\n“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a\\nmore gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\\nconfess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\\n\\n“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\\na way.”\\n\\n“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\\nway that would induce you to accept me.”\\n\\n“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”\\n\\nDarcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you\\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\\ncontents?”\\n\\nShe explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all\\nher former prejudices had been removed.\\n\\n“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\\nespecially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\\nof reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\\nmake you hate me.”\\n\\n“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\\nchanged as that implies.”\\n\\n“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly\\ncalm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.”\\n\\n“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\\nof the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely\\ndifferent from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\\nattending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\\nphilosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\\npleasure.”\\n\\n“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\\nignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\\nI was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\\ndoubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\\n\\n“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\\n\\n“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\\nwishing, expecting my addresses.”\\n\\n“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”\\n\\n“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\\ntake a proper direction.”\\n\\n“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\\n\\n“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\\n\\n“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”\\n\\n“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\\nintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\\nan hour after I had seen you.”\\n\\nHe then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\\ncomprehend.\\n\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\\neach to be dwelt on farther.\\n\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\\nanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\\nit was time to be at home.\\n\\n“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which\\nintroduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with\\ntheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\\nit.\\n\\n“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\\n\\n“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\\n\\n“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And\\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\\nthe case.\\n\\n“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\\nhim of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\\naffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\\nthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\\nmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\\nto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\\nunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”\\n\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\\nfriend.\\n\\n“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him\\nthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”\\n\\n“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”\\n\\n“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\\nhim.”\\n\\n“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\\nhis reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one\\nthing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\\nin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\\nnow.”\\n\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and\\nit was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of\\nBingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\\ncontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\\nparted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n     “Unable to utter a syllable”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question\\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\\nreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\n\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.\\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\\nthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\\nfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\\n“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\\nyou shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”\\n\\n“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\\nand I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\\nam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\\nare engaged.”\\n\\nJane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\\nyou dislike him.”\\n\\n“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\\ndid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\\nremember it myself.”\\n\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\nseriously, assured her of its truth.\\n\\n“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried\\nJane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\\ncertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\\nhappy with him?”\\n\\n“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\\nare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\\nShall you like to have such a brother?”\\n\\n“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\\nto do?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\\ntell you all.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\\nafraid you will be angry.”\\n\\n“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\\nLet me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me\\nhow long you have loved him?”\\n\\n“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\\nbut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\\nat Pemberley.”\\n\\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\\nfurther to wish.\\n\\n“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I\\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your\\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\\nof it to another, not to you.”\\n\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\\nher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\\nconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,\\nand half the night spent in conversation.\\n\\n“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\\nmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\\nour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\\ncoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\\nother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s\\nway.”\\n\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\\nepithet.\\n\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”\\n\\n“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\\nnever seen the view.”\\n\\n“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am\\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”\\n\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\\nconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\\nsaying,--\\n\\n“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\ndisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\\nall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\\nhim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\\n\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\\nasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\\napplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\ndisapprobation.\\n\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\\nMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\\nextreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\\nwants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\\n\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\\n\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\\nBut will they make you happy?”\\n\\n“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\\nindifference?”\\n\\n“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”\\n\\n“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\\nsuch terms.”\\n\\n“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\\nabout.”\\n\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\\nand, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\\nmonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\\nshe did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\\nmatch.\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\\n\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\\n\\n“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\\nand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\\n\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\\nMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\\nat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\\n\\nElizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\\nhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\\nthe others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\\nanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\\nwould come in time.\\n\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\\nfor, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\\nutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\\ncomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\\nwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\nlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\\n“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\\nhave thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\\nyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\\ndear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\\nLord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”\\n\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\\nher mother followed her.\\n\\n“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten\\nthousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a\\nspecial licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\\nBut, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\\nof, that I may have it to-morrow.”\\n\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman\\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\\nher deference for his opinion.\\n\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\\nevery hour in his esteem.\\n\\n“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,\\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\\nas Jane’s.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n“The obsequious civility.”\\n\\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LX.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nElizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could\\nyou begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\\nyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\\nplace?”\\n\\n“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\\nlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\\nknew that I _had_ begun.”\\n\\n“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\\nto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\\nto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be\\nsincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\\n\\n“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”\\n\\n“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\\nattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\\nand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and\\ninterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\\namiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you\\ntook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\\nin your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\ncourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;\\nand really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\\nreasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\\nof _that_ when they fall in love.”\\n\\n“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was\\nill at Netherfield?”\\n\\n“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\\nby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\\nto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\\nto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\\nbe; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling\\nto come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you\\nfirst called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”\\n\\n“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”\\n\\n“But I was embarrassed.”\\n\\n“And so was I.”\\n\\n“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\\n\\n“A man who had felt less might.”\\n\\n“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\\nI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\\nyou _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of\\nthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too\\nmuch_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\\nsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the\\nsubject? This will never do.”\\n\\n“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\\nCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\\nremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to\\nwait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,\\nand I was determined at once to know everything.”\\n\\n“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\\nor had you intended any more serious consequences?”\\n\\n“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\\nmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\\nmyself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and\\nif she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”\\n\\n“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\\nbefall her?”\\n\\n“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to\\nbe done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done\\ndirectly.”\\n\\n“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and\\nadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\\nI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”\\n\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\\nhad been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s\\nlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would\\nbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt\\nhad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\\nfor your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the\\ntruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,\\nindulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly\\nerr. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more\\nthan you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to\\nthe Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the\\nponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the\\nhappiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\\nbefore, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\\nonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\\ncan be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\nYours,” etc.\\n\\nMr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still\\ndifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return\\nfor his last.\\n\\n     /* “Dear Sir, */\\n\\n     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will\\n     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\\n     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\\n     more to give.\\n\\n“Yours sincerely,” etc.\\n\\nMiss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching\\nmarriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to\\nJane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former\\nprofessions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and\\nthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\n\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was\\nas sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\\nbeing loved by her sister.\\n\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\\nto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\\nsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that\\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\\nhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\\nmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did\\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his\\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s\\ngood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be\\nvulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at\\nall likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to\\nkeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might\\nconverse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its\\npleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward\\nwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society so\\nlittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their\\nfamily party at Pemberley.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LXI.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\\nrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she\\nafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be\\nguessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\\naccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of\\nher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\\namiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,\\nit was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous\\nand invariably silly.\\n\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\\ndrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\\ngoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\n\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\\na vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\\n_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\\nsisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\\nto Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\\nof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\n\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\\nher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\\nknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\\ntemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she\\nbecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\\nignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s\\nsociety she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\\nballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\n\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\\ndrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite\\nunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\\nshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\\nlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,\\nit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\\nmuch reluctance.\\n\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\\nthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\\neverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\\nprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The\\nletter was to this effect:--\\n\\n     /* “My dear Lizzy, */\\n\\n     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\\n     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\\n     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\\n     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\\n     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\\n     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\\n     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\\n     if you had rather not.\\n\\n“Yours,” etc.\\n\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in\\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\\nof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\\ndischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\\ncheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\\nfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\\nreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\\nreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him\\nfurther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when\\nher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\\nBingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even\\nBingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\n\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she\\nthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\\ndropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\\nattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\\nto Elizabeth.\\n\\nPemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters\\nwas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\\nother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\\nastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of\\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\\nher way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a\\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\n\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,\\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\\nand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n\\nWith the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,\\nas well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\\nher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\n                            [Illustration:\\n\\n                                  THE\\n                                  END\\n                                   ]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n             CHISWICK PRESS:--CHARLES WHITTINGHAM AND CO.\\n                  TOOKS COURT, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON.\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Their estate\\nwas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\\ntheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\\nrespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\\nsurrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\\nman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\\nlife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her\\ndeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\\nalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\\ninto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\\ninheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\\nbequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\\nchildren, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent. His\\nattachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and\\nMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\\ninterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\\nchildren added a relish to his existence.\\n\\nBy a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\\nlady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was\\namply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own\\nmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\\nwealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\\nso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\\nof what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting that\\nproperty, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\\nremaining moiety of his first wife’s fortune was also secured to her\\nchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.\\n\\nThe old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\\nwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so\\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but\\nhe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\\nbequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\\nand daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his\\nson’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\\nto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\\nby any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the\\nbenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\\nmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\\nsuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\\nyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\\nown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\\nall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\\nfrom his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however,\\nand, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\\nthousand pounds a-piece.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood’s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was\\ncheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,\\nand by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce\\nof an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\\nimprovement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\\nhis only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\\nthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for\\nhis widow and daughters.\\n\\nHis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\\nDashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\\ncould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\\nfamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\\nsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\\nthem comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\nand Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might\\nprudently be in his power to do for them.\\n\\nHe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\\nand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\\nrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\\nhis ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have\\nbeen made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been\\nmade amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very\\nfond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of\\nhimself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.\\n\\nWhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\\nincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\\npounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The\\nprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother’s fortune, warmed his\\nheart, and made him feel capable of generosity. “Yes, he would give\\nthem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\\nbe enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could\\nspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.” He thought of\\nit all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.\\n\\nNo sooner was his father’s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nwithout sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\\narrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her\\nright to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of his\\nfather’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\\ngreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood’s situation, with only common\\nfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there was\\na sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of\\nthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of\\nimmovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with\\nany of her husband’s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the\\npresent, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of\\nother people she could act when occasion required it.\\n\\nSo acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\\nearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\\narrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\\nnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the\\npropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children\\ndetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach\\nwith their brother.\\n\\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\\na strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\\nher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\\nenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\\nthat eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\\nto imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was\\naffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\\none of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\n\\nMarianne’s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor’s.\\nShe was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\\njoys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting:\\nshe was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her\\nmother was strikingly great.\\n\\nElinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister’s sensibility; but\\nby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\\nother now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which\\noverpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was\\ncreated again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their\\nsorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could\\nafford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future.\\nElinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she\\ncould exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could receive\\nher sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;\\nand could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage\\nher to similar forbearance.\\n\\nMargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but\\nas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne’s romance, without\\nhaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal\\nher sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\\nmother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\\nAs such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\\nher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them, with\\nsome earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan\\nappeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could\\naccommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation\\nwas accepted.\\n\\nA continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\\ndelight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness,\\nno temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\\ndegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\\nitself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\\nto do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\\nof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\\ndreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How\\ncould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,\\nof so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,\\nwho were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no\\nrelationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount. It\\nwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he\\nto ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his\\nmoney to his half sisters?\\n\\n“It was my father’s last request to me,” replied her husband, “that I\\nshould assist his widow and daughters.”\\n\\n“He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\\nwas light-headed at the time. Had he been in his right senses, he could\\nnot have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your\\nfortune from your own child.”\\n\\n“He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\\nrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\\nsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it\\nwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could\\nhardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise, I\\ncould not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. The\\npromise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something must be\\ndone for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home.”\\n\\n“Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something\\nneed not be three thousand pounds. Consider,” she added, “that when the\\nmoney is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will\\nmarry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored\\nto our poor little boy—”\\n\\n“Why, to be sure,” said her husband, very gravely, “that would make\\ngreat difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so\\nlarge a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for\\ninstance, it would be a very convenient addition.”\\n\\n“To be sure it would.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\\ndiminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase\\nto their fortunes!”\\n\\n“Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so much\\nfor his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters! And as it is—only half\\nblood!—But you have such a generous spirit!”\\n\\n“I would not wish to do any thing mean,” he replied. “One had rather,\\non such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can\\nthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly\\nexpect more.”\\n\\n“There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,” said the lady, “but we\\nare not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can\\nafford to do.”\\n\\n“Certainly—and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\\na-piece. As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\\nabout three thousand pounds on their mother’s death—a very comfortable\\nfortune for any young woman.”\\n\\n“To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\\naddition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\\nthem. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\\nnot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten\\nthousand pounds.”\\n\\n“That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\\nwhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother\\nwhile she lives, rather than for them—something of the annuity kind I\\nmean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\nA hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.”\\n\\nHis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this\\nplan.\\n\\n“To be sure,” said she, “it is better than parting with fifteen hundred\\npounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years\\nwe shall be completely taken in.”\\n\\n“Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\\npurchase.”\\n\\n“Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\\nthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,\\nand hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\\nand over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You are not\\naware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the trouble\\nof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to\\nold superannuated servants by my father’s will, and it is amazing how\\ndisagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be\\npaid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then\\none of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be\\nno such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her\\nown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more\\nunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been\\nentirely at my mother’s disposal, without any restriction whatever. It\\nhas given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would\\nnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.”\\n\\n“It is certainly an unpleasant thing,” replied Mr. Dashwood, “to have\\nthose kind of yearly drains on one’s income. One’s fortune, as your\\nmother justly says, is _not_ one’s own. To be tied down to the regular\\npayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\\ntakes away one’s independence.”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think\\nthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\\nno gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my\\nown discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any\\nthing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\\nhundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.”\\n\\n“I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\\nbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\\nbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\\nwould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\\nincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\\nyear. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty\\npounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\\nmoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my\\nfather.”\\n\\n“To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\\nmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\\nall. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\\nbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\\ncomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\\nand sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they\\nare in season. I’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider,\\nmy dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law\\nand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,\\nbesides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which\\nbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will\\npay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have\\nfive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want\\nfor more than that?—They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be\\nnothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any\\nservants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any\\nkind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year!\\nI am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to\\nyour giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be\\nmuch more able to give _you_ something.”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” said Mr. Dashwood, “I believe you are perfectly right.\\nMy father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\\nwhat you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\\nhave described. When my mother removes into another house my services\\nshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little\\npresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” returned Mrs. John Dashwood. “But, however, _one_ thing\\nmust be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland,\\nthough the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\\nlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will\\ntherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.”\\n\\n“That is a material consideration undoubtedly. A valuable legacy\\nindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\\naddition to our own stock here.”\\n\\n“Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\\nbelongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\\nany place _they_ can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is.\\nYour father thought only of _them_. And I must say this: that you owe\\nno particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we\\nvery well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything\\nin the world to _them_.”\\n\\nThis argument was irresistible. It gave to his intentions whatever of\\ndecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be\\nabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the\\nwidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as\\nhis own wife pointed out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any\\ndisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased\\nto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when\\nher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other\\nexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy\\nremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her\\ninquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for\\nto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could hear\\nof no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease,\\nand suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment\\nrejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother\\nwould have approved.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on\\nthe part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last\\nearthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no\\nmore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her\\ndaughters’ sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000£ would support her in\\naffluence. For their brother’s sake, too, for the sake of his own\\nheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his\\nmerit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. His attentive\\nbehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare\\nwas dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the\\nliberality of his intentions.\\n\\nThe contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for\\nher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge\\nof her character, which half a year’s residence in her family afforded;\\nand perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\\naffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it\\nimpossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular\\ncircumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to\\nthe opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters’ continuance at\\nNorland.\\n\\nThis circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and\\nthe brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young\\nman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister’s\\nestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of\\nhis time there.\\n\\nSome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of\\ninterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died\\nvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,\\nfor, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the\\nwill of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either\\nconsideration. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\\nthat he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality. It\\nwas contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune\\nshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of\\ndisposition; and that Elinor’s merit should not be acknowledged by\\nevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.\\n\\nEdward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any\\npeculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his\\nmanners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident\\nto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His\\nunderstanding was good, and his education had given it solid\\nimprovement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\\nanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\\ndistinguished—as—they hardly knew what. They wanted him to make a fine\\nfigure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to\\ninterest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to\\nsee him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John\\nDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\\nsuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\\nambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for\\ngreat men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and\\nthe quiet of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother who was\\nmore promising.\\n\\nEdward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged\\nmuch of Mrs. Dashwood’s attention; for she was, at that time, in such\\naffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw\\nonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He\\ndid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.\\nShe was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a\\nreflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference\\nbetween him and his sister. It was a contrast which recommended him\\nmost forcibly to her mother.\\n\\n“It is enough,” said she; “to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough. It\\nimplies everything amiable. I love him already.”\\n\\n“I think you will like him,” said Elinor, “when you know more of him.”\\n\\n“Like him!” replied her mother with a smile. “I feel no sentiment of\\napprobation inferior to love.”\\n\\n“You may esteem him.”\\n\\n“I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. Her manners\\nwere attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily\\ncomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor\\nperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his\\nworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all\\nher established ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be, was no\\nlonger uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper\\naffectionate.\\n\\nNo sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to\\nElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and\\nlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.\\n\\n“In a few months, my dear Marianne,” said she, “Elinor will, in all\\nprobability be settled for life. We shall miss her; but _she_ will be\\nhappy.”\\n\\n“Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?”\\n\\n“My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few\\nmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will\\ngain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest\\nopinion in the world of Edward’s heart. But you look grave, Marianne;\\ndo you disapprove your sister’s choice?”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Marianne, “I may consider it with some surprise. Edward\\nis very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet—he is not the kind of\\nyoung man—there is something wanting—his figure is not striking; it has\\nnone of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously\\nattach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at\\nonce announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am\\nafraid, Mama, he has no real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract\\nhim, and though he admires Elinor’s drawings very much, it is not the\\nadmiration of a person who can understand their worth. It is evident,\\nin spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact\\nhe knows nothing of the matter. He admires as a lover, not as a\\nconnoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could\\nnot be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide\\nwith my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the\\nsame music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was\\nEdward’s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most\\nseverely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely\\nto notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful\\nlines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such\\nimpenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!”\\n\\n\\n“He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.\\nI thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.”\\n\\n“Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow\\nfor difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she\\nmay overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke _my_\\nheart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.\\nMama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I\\nshall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He\\nmust have all Edward’s virtues, and his person and manners must\\nornament his goodness with every possible charm.”\\n\\n“Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in\\nlife to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate\\nthan your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your\\ndestiny be different from hers!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\n“What a pity it is, Elinor,” said Marianne, “that Edward should have no\\ntaste for drawing.”\\n\\n“No taste for drawing!” replied Elinor, “why should you think so? He\\ndoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the\\nperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means\\ndeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of\\nimproving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would\\nhave drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so\\nmuch, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture;\\nbut he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in\\ngeneral direct him perfectly right.”\\n\\nMarianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but\\nthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the\\ndrawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,\\nwhich, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet, though smiling\\nwithin herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blind\\npartiality to Edward which produced it.\\n\\n“I hope, Marianne,” continued Elinor, “you do not consider him as\\ndeficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,\\nfor your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were your\\nopinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.”\\n\\nMarianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of\\nher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was\\nimpossible. At length she replied:\\n\\n“Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing\\nequal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many opportunities\\nof estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations\\nand tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of\\nhis goodness and sense. I think him every thing that is worthy and\\namiable.”\\n\\n“I am sure,” replied Elinor, with a smile, “that his dearest friends\\ncould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not\\nperceive how you could express yourself more warmly.”\\n\\nMarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.\\n\\n“Of his sense and his goodness,” continued Elinor, “no one can, I\\nthink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in\\nunreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his\\nprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\\nhim silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\\nBut of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\\npeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I\\nhave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\\nwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I\\nhave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\\nhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I\\nventure to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books\\nexceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and\\ncorrect, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every\\nrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At\\nfirst sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can\\nhardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are\\nuncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is\\nperceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really\\nhandsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?”\\n\\n“I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When\\nyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection\\nin his face, than I now do in his heart.”\\n\\nElinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she\\nhad been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood\\nvery high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but she\\nrequired greater certainty of it to make Marianne’s conviction of their\\nattachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her mother\\nconjectured one moment, they believed the next—that with them, to wish\\nwas to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain the real\\nstate of the case to her sister.\\n\\n“I do not attempt to deny,” said she, “that I think very highly of\\nhim—that I greatly esteem, that I like him.”\\n\\nMarianne here burst forth with indignation—\\n\\n“Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than\\ncold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I\\nwill leave the room this moment.”\\n\\nElinor could not help laughing. “Excuse me,” said she; “and be assured\\nthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my\\nown feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe\\nthem, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion—the hope of\\nhis affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But\\nfarther than this you must _not_ believe. I am by no means assured of\\nhis regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems\\ndoubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at\\nmy wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by\\nbelieving or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel\\nlittle—scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points\\nto be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being\\nindependent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from\\nFanny’s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never\\nbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if\\nEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in\\nhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great\\nfortune or high rank.”\\n\\nMarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother\\nand herself had outstripped the truth.\\n\\n“And you really are not engaged to him!” said she. “Yet it certainly\\nsoon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. _I_\\nshall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of\\nimproving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be\\nso indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should be\\nso far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how\\ndelightful it would be!”\\n\\nElinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not consider\\nher partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had\\nbelieved it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if\\nit did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as\\nunpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not\\ngive him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that\\ndejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable\\ncause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the\\nindulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved\\nto him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him\\nany assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly\\nattending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as\\nthis, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was\\nfar from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her\\nmother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they\\nwere together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and\\nsometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more\\nthan friendship.\\n\\nBut, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived\\nby his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was\\nstill more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first opportunity\\nof affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so\\nexpressively of her brother’s great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars’s\\nresolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger\\nattending any young woman who attempted to _draw him in;_ that Mrs.\\nDashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be\\ncalm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly\\nleft the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or\\nexpense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be\\nexposed another week to such insinuations.\\n\\nIn this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the\\npost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the\\noffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of\\nher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The\\nletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\\nof friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a\\ndwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,\\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which she might\\nthink necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly pressed\\nher, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with\\nher daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from\\nwhence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses\\nwere in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable\\nto her. He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of\\nhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of\\ngiving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was\\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer\\nconnections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her\\nresolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county\\nso far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours\\nbefore, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\\npossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first\\nrecommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an\\nevil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of\\nthe misery of continuing her daughter-in-law’s guest; and to remove for\\never from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or\\nvisit it while such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir\\nJohn Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance\\nof his proposal; and then hastened to show both letters to her\\ndaughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her\\nanswer were sent.\\n\\nElinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle\\nat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present\\nacquaintance. On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose\\nher mother’s intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as\\ndescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so\\nuncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either\\npoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm\\nto her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland\\nbeyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from\\nsending a letter of acquiescence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged\\nherself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife\\nthat she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer\\nthan till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her\\nwith surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly\\nhoped that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great\\nsatisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.—Edward\\nturned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of\\nsurprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,\\n“Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to\\nwhat part of it?” She explained the situation. It was within four miles\\nnorthward of Exeter.\\n\\n“It is but a cottage,” she continued, “but I hope to see many of my\\nfriends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends\\nfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will\\nfind none in accommodating them.”\\n\\nShe concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood\\nto visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater\\naffection. Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had\\nmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was\\nunavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that\\npoint to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor was\\nas far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John\\nDashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she\\ndisregarded her disapprobation of the match.\\n\\nMr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry\\nhe was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to\\nprevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. He\\nreally felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very\\nexertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his\\nfather was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.—The furniture\\nwas all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen,\\nplate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne’s. Mrs.\\nJohn Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help\\nfeeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood’s income would be so trifling in\\ncomparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of\\nfurniture.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,\\nand she might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either\\nside in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her\\neffects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she\\nset off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the\\nperformance of everything that interested her, was soon done.—The\\nhorses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his\\ndeath, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,\\nshe agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest\\ndaughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her\\nown wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor\\nprevailed. _Her_ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to\\nthree; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from\\namongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.\\n\\nThe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,\\nto prepare the house for their mistress’s arrival; for as Lady\\nMiddleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going\\ndirectly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she\\nrelied so undoubtingly on Sir John’s description of the house, as to\\nfeel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.\\nHer eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by\\nthe evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her\\nremoval; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\\nunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time\\nwhen her son-in-law’s promise to his father might with particular\\npropriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it on first coming\\nto the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most\\nsuitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly\\nto give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the\\ngeneral drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther\\nthan their maintenance for six months at Norland. He so frequently\\ntalked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual\\ndemands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was\\nbeyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need\\nof more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.\\n\\nIn a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton’s\\nfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future\\nabode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their\\njourney.\\n\\nMany were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so\\nmuch beloved. “Dear, dear Norland!” said Marianne, as she wandered\\nalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; “when\\nshall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh!\\nhappy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this\\nspot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you, ye\\nwell-known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay\\nbecause we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we\\ncan observe you no longer!—No; you will continue the same; unconscious\\nof the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any\\nchange in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nThe first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\\ndisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they\\ndrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\\ncountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view\\nof Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It was a\\npleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After winding\\nalong it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A small\\ngreen court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket\\ngate admitted them into it.\\n\\nAs a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\\nbut as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the\\nroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were\\nthe walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly\\nthrough the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance\\nwas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the\\noffices and the stairs. Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest\\nof the house. It had not been built many years and was in good repair.\\nIn comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!—but the tears\\nwhich recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon\\ndried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their\\narrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\\nIt was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first\\nseeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an\\nimpression in its favour which was of material service in recommending\\nit to their lasting approbation.\\n\\nThe situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately\\nbehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\\ndowns, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was\\nchiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\\ncottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded\\nthe whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond. The hills\\nwhich surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction;\\nunder another name, and in another course, it branched out again\\nbetween two of the steepest of them.\\n\\nWith the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the\\nwhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many\\nadditions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a\\ndelight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply\\nall that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. “As for the\\nhouse itself, to be sure,” said she, “it is too small for our family,\\nbut we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it\\nis too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring, if I\\nhave plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about\\nbuilding. These parlors are both too small for such parties of our\\nfriends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts\\nof throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the\\nother, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,\\nwith a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber\\nand garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage. I could wish\\nthe stairs were handsome. But one must not expect every thing; though I\\nsuppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see how\\nmuch I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan\\nour improvements accordingly.”\\n\\nIn the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the\\nsavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved\\nin her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it\\nwas; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,\\nand endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to\\nform themselves a home. Marianne’s pianoforte was unpacked and properly\\ndisposed of; and Elinor’s drawings were affixed to the walls of their\\nsitting room.\\n\\nIn such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast\\nthe next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome\\nthem to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own\\nhouse and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient. Sir\\nJohn Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He had formerly\\nvisited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to\\nremember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his\\nmanners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their arrival\\nseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an\\nobject of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest desire of\\ntheir living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed\\nthem so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were\\nbetter settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a\\npoint of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence. His\\nkindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left\\nthem, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the\\npark, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of\\ngame. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and from\\nthe post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending\\nthem his newspaper every day.\\n\\nLady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her\\nintention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured\\nthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was\\nanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced\\nto them the next day.\\n\\nThey were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of\\ntheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance\\nwas favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more than six or\\nseven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking,\\nand her address graceful. Her manners had all the elegance which her\\nhusband’s wanted. But they would have been improved by some share of\\nhis frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract\\nsomething from their first admiration, by showing that, though\\nperfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for\\nherself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.\\n\\nConversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and\\nLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their\\neldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means\\nthere was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of\\nextremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,\\nand ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung\\nabout her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her\\nladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could\\nmake noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child ought to be of\\nthe party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it\\ntook up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his\\nfather or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of\\ncourse every body differed, and every body was astonished at the\\nopinion of the others.\\n\\nAn opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the\\nrest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without\\nsecuring their promise of dining at the park the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nBarton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had\\npassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from\\ntheir view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large and\\nhandsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and\\nelegance. The former was for Sir John’s gratification, the latter for\\nthat of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends staying\\nwith them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than\\nany other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to the\\nhappiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward\\nbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of\\ntalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with\\nsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a\\nsportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she\\nhumoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady\\nMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the\\nyear round, while Sir John’s independent employments were in existence\\nonly half the time. Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,\\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the\\ngood spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his\\nwife.\\n\\nLady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of\\nall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her\\ngreatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John’s satisfaction\\nin society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him\\nmore young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were\\nthe better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the juvenile part\\nof the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to\\neat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls\\nwere numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the\\nunsatiable appetite of fifteen.\\n\\nThe arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy\\nto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants\\nhe had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were\\nyoung, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good\\nopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to\\nmake her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his\\ndisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation\\nmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In\\nshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his\\ncottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,\\nthough he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is\\nnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a\\nresidence within his own manor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by\\nSir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;\\nand as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young\\nladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day\\nbefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They\\nwould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a\\nparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very\\nyoung nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the\\nparty, and could assure them it should never happen so again. He had\\nbeen to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some\\naddition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full\\nof engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton’s mother had arrived at Barton\\nwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,\\nhe hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might\\nimagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly\\nsatisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for\\nno more.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton’s mother, was a good-humoured, merry,\\nfat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and\\nrather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner\\nwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and\\nhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was\\nvexed at it for her sister’s sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor\\nto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave\\nElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery\\nas Mrs. Jennings’s.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by\\nresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be\\nhis wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton’s mother. He was silent\\nand grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his\\nbeing in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor,\\nfor he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his face\\nwas not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address was\\nparticularly gentlemanlike.\\n\\nThere was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as\\ncompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton\\nwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of\\nColonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his\\nmother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to\\nenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,\\nwho pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of\\ndiscourse except what related to themselves.\\n\\nIn the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was\\ninvited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be\\ncharmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went\\nthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in\\nthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated\\nthat event by giving up music, although by her mother’s account, she\\nhad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.\\n\\nMarianne’s performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his\\nadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation\\nwith the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently\\ncalled him to order, wondered how any one’s attention could be diverted\\nfrom music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song\\nwhich Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon alone, of all the\\nparty, heard her without being in raptures. He paid her only the\\ncompliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the\\noccasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless\\nwant of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that\\necstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was\\nestimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the\\nothers; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and\\nthirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every\\nexquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every\\nallowance for the colonel’s advanced state of life which humanity\\nrequired.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two\\ndaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and\\nshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the\\nworld. In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as far\\nas her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting\\nweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She was\\nremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the\\nadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by\\ninsinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of\\ndiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to\\npronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne\\nDashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening\\nof their being together, from his listening so attentively while she\\nsang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons’ dining\\nat the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.\\nIt must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would be an\\nexcellent match, for _he_ was rich, and _she_ was handsome. Mrs.\\nJennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever\\nsince her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge;\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.\\n\\nThe immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for\\nit supplied her with endless jokes against them both. At the park she\\nlaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former\\nher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,\\nperfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first\\nincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew\\nwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,\\nfor she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel’s\\nadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than\\nherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of\\nher daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of\\nwishing to throw ridicule on his age.\\n\\n“But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,\\nthough you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon\\nis certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be\\n_my_ father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must\\nhave long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!\\nWhen is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not\\nprotect him?”\\n\\n“Infirmity!” said Elinor, “do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can\\neasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my\\nmother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of\\nhis limbs!”\\n\\n“Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the\\ncommonest infirmity of declining life?”\\n\\n“My dearest child,” said her mother, laughing, “at this rate you must\\nbe in continual terror of _my_ decay; and it must seem to you a miracle\\nthat my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.”\\n\\n“Mama, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel\\nBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of\\nlosing him in the course of nature. He may live twenty years longer.\\nBut thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Elinor, “thirty-five and seventeen had better not have\\nany thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any\\nchance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should\\nnot think Colonel Brandon’s being thirty-five any objection to his\\nmarrying _her_.”\\n\\n“A woman of seven and twenty,” said Marianne, after pausing a moment,\\n“can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be\\nuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring\\nherself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the\\nprovision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman\\ntherefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of\\nconvenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be\\nno marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem only\\na commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the\\nexpense of the other.”\\n\\n“It would be impossible, I know,” replied Elinor, “to convince you that\\na woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five\\nanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.\\nBut I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the\\nconstant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to\\ncomplain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in\\none of his shoulders.”\\n\\n“But he talked of flannel waistcoats,” said Marianne; “and with me a\\nflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,\\nrheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and\\nthe feeble.”\\n\\n“Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him\\nhalf so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to\\nyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?”\\n\\nSoon after this, upon Elinor’s leaving the room, “Mama,” said Marianne,\\n“I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from\\nyou. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now been here almost\\na fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but real indisposition\\ncould occasion this extraordinary delay. What else can detain him at\\nNorland?”\\n\\n“Had you any idea of his coming so soon?” said Mrs. Dashwood. “_I_ had\\nnone. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the\\nsubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of\\npleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his\\ncoming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?”\\n\\n“I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.”\\n\\n“I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her\\nyesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed\\nthat there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the\\nroom would be wanted for some time.”\\n\\n“How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of\\ntheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how\\ncomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the\\nlast evening of their being together! In Edward’s farewell there was no\\ndistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an\\naffectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely together\\nin the course of the last morning, and each time did he most\\nunaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting\\nNorland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is\\ninvariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to\\navoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to\\nthemselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding\\nthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had\\ngiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater\\nenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their\\nfather. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first\\nfortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at\\nhome, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.\\n\\nTheir visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in\\nspite of Sir John’s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the\\nneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at\\ntheir service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood’s spirit overcame the\\nwish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to\\nvisit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who\\ncould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.\\nAbout a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding\\nvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly\\ndescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an\\nancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little\\nof Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be\\nbetter acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its\\npossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately\\ntoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.\\n\\nThe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high\\ndowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\\nseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\\nalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior\\nbeauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one\\nmemorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine\\nof a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the\\nsettled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weather was\\nnot tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their\\nbook, in spite of Marianne’s declaration that the day would be\\nlastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off\\nfrom their hills; and the two girls set off together.\\n\\nThey gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at\\nevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the\\nanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears\\nwhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such\\ndelightful sensations.\\n\\n“Is there a felicity in the world,” said Marianne, “superior to\\nthis?—Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.”\\n\\nMargaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting\\nit with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly\\nthe clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in\\ntheir face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though\\nunwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own\\nhouse. One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence\\nof the moment gave more than usual propriety,—it was that of running\\nwith all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led\\nimmediately to their garden gate.\\n\\nThey set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step\\nbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop\\nherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the\\nbottom in safety.\\n\\nA gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was\\npassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her\\naccident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She\\nhad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in\\nher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered his\\nservices; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation\\nrendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, and\\ncarried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden, the gate of\\nwhich had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the\\nhouse, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till\\nhe had seated her in a chair in the parlour.\\n\\nElinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while\\nthe eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret\\nadmiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for\\nhis intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so\\ngraceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received\\nadditional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been even old,\\nugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\\nhave been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the\\ninfluence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the\\naction which came home to her feelings.\\n\\nShe thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which\\nalways attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he declined, as\\nhe was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was\\nobliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home was\\nat Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of\\ncalling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The honour was readily\\ngranted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting,\\nin the midst of a heavy rain.\\n\\nHis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\\ntheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\\nagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\\nattractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his person than the\\nrest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\\nher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\\nentering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the\\nadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\\npraise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\\nfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\\nhouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\\nthought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every\\ncircumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his\\nresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\\nof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her\\nimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\\nsprained ankle was disregarded.\\n\\nSir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\\nthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne’s accident\\nbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any\\ngentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\\n\\n“Willoughby!” cried Sir John; “what, is _he_ in the country? That is\\ngood news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on\\nThursday.”\\n\\n“You know him then,” said Mrs. Dashwood.\\n\\n“Know him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year.”\\n\\n“And what sort of a young man is he?”\\n\\n“As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent\\nshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.”\\n\\n“And is _that_ all you can say for him?” cried Marianne, indignantly.\\n“But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his\\npursuits, his talents, and genius?”\\n\\nSir John was rather puzzled.\\n\\n“Upon my soul,” said he, “I do not know much about him as to all\\n_that_. But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the\\nnicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she out with him\\ntoday?”\\n\\nBut Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\\nWilloughby’s pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his\\nmind.\\n\\n“But who is he?” said Elinor. “Where does he come from? Has he a house\\nat Allenham?”\\n\\nOn this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\\ntold them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\\ncountry; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\\nat Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\\nto inherit; adding, “Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can\\ntell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in\\nSomersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my\\nyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne\\nmust not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be\\njealous, if she does not take care.”\\n\\n“I do not believe,” said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,\\n“that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of\\n_my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him_. It is not an\\nemployment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with\\nus, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what you\\nsay, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance\\nwill not be ineligible.”\\n\\n“He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,” repeated\\nSir John. “I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he\\ndanced from eight o’clock till four, without once sitting down.”\\n\\n“Did he indeed?” cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, “and with\\nelegance, with spirit?”\\n\\n“Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.”\\n\\n“That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever be\\nhis pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and\\nleave him no sense of fatigue.”\\n\\n“Aye, aye, I see how it will be,” said Sir John, “I see how it will be.\\nYou will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor\\nBrandon.”\\n\\n“That is an expression, Sir John,” said Marianne, warmly, “which I\\nparticularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is\\nintended; and ‘setting one’s cap at a man,’ or ‘making a conquest,’ are\\nthe most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if\\ntheir construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago\\ndestroyed all its ingenuity.”\\n\\nSir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as\\nheartily as if he did, and then replied,\\n\\n“Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. Poor\\nBrandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting\\nyour cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and\\nspraining of ankles.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nMarianne’s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,\\nstyled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make\\nhis personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than\\npoliteness; with a kindness which Sir John’s account of him and her own\\ngratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the visit tended\\nto assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic\\ncomfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him. Of their\\npersonal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced.\\n\\nMiss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a\\nremarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form,\\nthough not so correct as her sister’s, in having the advantage of\\nheight, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the\\ncommon cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less\\nviolently outraged than usually happens. Her skin was very brown, but,\\nfrom its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her\\nfeatures were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her\\neyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,\\nwhich could hardly be seen without delight. From Willoughby their\\nexpression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the\\nremembrance of his assistance created. But when this passed away, when\\nher spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect\\ngood-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and\\nabove all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was\\npassionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured\\nthe largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.\\n\\nIt was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\\nto talk. She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\\nshe had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily\\ndiscovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\\nthat it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related\\nto either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,\\nshe proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her favourite\\nauthors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a\\ndelight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been\\ninsensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence\\nof such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was strikingly\\nalike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by each—or if\\nany difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than\\ntill the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be\\ndisplayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her\\nenthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with\\nthe familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\\n\\n“Well, Marianne,” said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, “for _one_\\nmorning I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained\\nMr. Willoughby’s opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know\\nwhat he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating\\ntheir beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of\\nhis admiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance\\nto be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every\\nsubject for discourse? You will soon have exhausted each favourite\\ntopic. Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on\\npicturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then you can have nothing\\nfarther to ask.”\\n\\n“Elinor,” cried Marianne, “is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\\nscanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too\\nhappy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of\\ndecorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\\nreserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful—had I talked only of the\\nweather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this\\nreproach would have been spared.”\\n\\n“My love,” said her mother, “you must not be offended with Elinor—she\\nwas only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of\\nwishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend.”\\nMarianne was softened in a moment.\\n\\nWilloughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\\nacquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He\\ncame to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his\\nexcuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\\ngreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased\\nto be possible, by Marianne’s perfect recovery. She was confined for\\nsome days to the house; but never had any confinement been less\\nirksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\\nimagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was\\nexactly formed to engage Marianne’s heart, for with all this, he joined\\nnot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was\\nnow roused and increased by the example of her own, and which\\nrecommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\\n\\nHis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read,\\nthey talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;\\nand he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had\\nunfortunately wanted.\\n\\nIn Mrs. Dashwood’s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne’s; and\\nElinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\\nstrongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\\nmuch what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or\\ncircumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\\npeople, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided\\nattention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the\\nforms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor\\ncould not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in\\nits support.\\n\\nMarianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\\nher at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\\nideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was\\nall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\\nbrighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour\\ndeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\\nwere strong.\\n\\nHer mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\\nmarriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the\\nend of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate\\nherself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\\n\\nColonel Brandon’s partiality for Marianne, which had so early been\\ndiscovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when\\nit ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit were drawn off\\nto his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had\\nincurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings\\nbegan really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.\\nElinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments\\nwhich Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now\\nactually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance\\nof disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.\\nWilloughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no\\nhindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She saw it with concern;\\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a\\nvery lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him\\nsuccessful, she heartily wished him indifferent. She liked him—in spite\\nof his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest.\\nHis manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather\\nthe result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess\\nof temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and\\ndisappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate\\nman, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.\\n\\nPerhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by\\nWilloughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither\\nlively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\\n\\n“Brandon is just the kind of man,” said Willoughby one day, when they\\nwere talking of him together, “whom every body speaks well of, and\\nnobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\\nto talk to.”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I think of him,” cried Marianne.\\n\\n“Do not boast of it, however,” said Elinor, “for it is injustice in\\nboth of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I\\nnever see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.”\\n\\n“That he is patronised by _you_,” replied Willoughby, “is certainly in\\nhis favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in\\nitself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a\\nwoman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the\\nindifference of any body else?”\\n\\n“But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will\\nmake amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their\\npraise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more\\nundiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.”\\n\\n“In defence of your _protégé_ you can even be saucy.”\\n\\n“My _protégé_, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will\\nalways have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between\\nthirty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been\\nabroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of\\ngiving me much information on various subjects; and he has always\\nanswered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.”\\n\\n“That is to say,” cried Marianne contemptuously, “he has told you, that\\nin the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are\\ntroublesome.”\\n\\n“He _would_ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such\\ninquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been\\npreviously informed.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Willoughby, “his observations may have extended to the\\nexistence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.”\\n\\n“I may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much\\nfurther than _your_ candour. But why should you dislike him?”\\n\\n“I do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very\\nrespectable man, who has every body’s good word, and nobody’s notice;\\nwho has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to\\nemploy, and two new coats every year.”\\n\\n“Add to which,” cried Marianne, “that he has neither genius, taste, nor\\nspirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no\\nardour, and his voice no expression.”\\n\\n“You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,” replied Elinor,\\n“and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the\\ncommendation _I_ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and\\ninsipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,\\nwell-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable\\nheart.”\\n\\n“Miss Dashwood,” cried Willoughby, “you are now using me unkindly. You\\nare endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my\\nwill. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be\\nartful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel\\nBrandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has\\nfound fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him\\nto buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,\\nto be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects\\nirreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for an\\nacknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the\\nprivilege of disliking him as much as ever.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nLittle had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came\\ninto Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their\\ntime as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such\\nfrequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\\nleisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When Marianne\\nwas recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir\\nJohn had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private\\nballs at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and\\naccomplished as often as a showery October would allow. In every\\nmeeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\\nfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\\ncalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\\nDashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\\nMarianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\\nin her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\\naffection.\\n\\nElinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished that\\nit were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to suggest the\\npropriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne abhorred all\\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim\\nat the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable,\\nappeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful\\nsubjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions. Willoughby\\nthought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration\\nof their opinions.\\n\\nWhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he\\ndid, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at\\nthe park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest\\nof the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of\\nthe night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to\\nseparate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and\\nscarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made them of\\ncourse most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and\\nseemed hardly to provoke them.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left\\nher no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her\\nit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and\\nardent mind.\\n\\nThis was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to\\nWilloughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with\\nher from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it\\npossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her\\npresent home.\\n\\nElinor’s happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at ease,\\nnor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded her no\\ncompanion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that\\ncould teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever. Neither\\nLady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation\\nshe missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the\\nfirst had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share\\nof her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor\\nthree or four times; and had Elinor’s memory been equal to her means of\\nimprovement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all\\nthe particulars of Mr. Jennings’s last illness, and what he said to his\\nwife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable\\nthan her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little\\nobservation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner\\nwith which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she\\nwas the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be\\nlooked for nor desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not\\nsaid the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her\\nspirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties\\narranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style\\nand her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive\\nmore enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at\\nhome;—and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others,\\nby any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only\\nreminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her\\ntroublesome boys.\\n\\nIn Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\\na person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite\\nthe interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion. Willoughby\\nwas out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly\\nregard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly\\nMarianne’s, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally\\npleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such\\nencouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor\\nhe found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister.\\n\\nElinor’s compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\\nthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\\nThis suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\\nhim one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\\nmutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on\\nMarianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\\nsmile, “Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second\\nattachments.”\\n\\n“No,” replied Elinor, “her opinions are all romantic.”\\n\\n“Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.”\\n\\n“I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on the\\ncharacter of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A\\nfew years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of\\ncommon sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define\\nand to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.”\\n\\n“This will probably be the case,” he replied; “and yet there is\\nsomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is\\nsorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.”\\n\\n“I cannot agree with you there,” said Elinor. “There are inconveniences\\nattending such feelings as Marianne’s, which all the charms of\\nenthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her systems\\nhave all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a\\nbetter acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her\\ngreatest possible advantage.”\\n\\nAfter a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,—\\n\\n“Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a\\nsecond attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those\\nwho have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the\\ninconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\\nequally indifferent during the rest of their lives?”\\n\\n“Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.\\nI only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second\\nattachment’s being pardonable.”\\n\\n“This,” said he, “cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\\nsentiments—No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements\\nof a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they\\nsucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I\\nspeak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind\\ngreatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who\\nfrom an enforced change—from a series of unfortunate circumstances—”\\nHere he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,\\nand by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not\\notherwise have entered Elinor’s head. The lady would probably have\\npassed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what\\nconcerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it was, it required but\\na slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender\\nrecollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But Marianne, in\\nher place, would not have done so little. The whole story would have\\nbeen speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing\\nestablished in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\nAs Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the\\nlatter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of\\nall that she knew before of Marianne’s imprudence and want of thought,\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her,\\nwith the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one\\nthat he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was\\nnot in her mother’s plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter\\nher resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the\\nservant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\\nto receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and\\ntold her sister of it in raptures.\\n\\n“He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,”\\nshe added, “and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall share\\nits use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a\\ngallop on some of these downs.”\\n\\nMost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to\\ncomprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for\\nsome time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,\\nthe expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to\\nit; and any horse would do for _him;_ he might always get one at the\\npark; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then\\nventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a\\nman so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too much.\\n\\n“You are mistaken, Elinor,” said she warmly, “in supposing I know very\\nlittle of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much\\nbetter acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the\\nworld, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is\\nto determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone. Seven years would be\\ninsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of\\ngreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\\nWilloughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together\\nfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.”\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her\\nsister’s temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach\\nher the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for\\nher mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she\\nconsented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly\\nsubdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent\\nkindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw\\nhim next, that it must be declined.\\n\\nShe was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the\\ncottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to\\nhim in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his\\npresent. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,\\nand they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.\\nHis concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with\\nearnestness, he added, in the same low voice,—“But, Marianne, the horse\\nis still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till\\nyou can claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment\\nin a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you.”\\n\\nThis was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the\\nsentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her\\nsister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so\\ndecided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between\\nthem. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each\\nother; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or\\nany of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover\\nit by accident.\\n\\nMargaret related something to her the next day, which placed this\\nmatter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding\\nevening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\\nwith only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,\\nwhich, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest\\nsister, when they were next by themselves.\\n\\n“Oh, Elinor!” she cried, “I have such a secret to tell you about\\nMarianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.”\\n\\n“You have said so,” replied Elinor, “almost every day since they first\\nmet on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I\\nbelieve, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round\\nher neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great\\nuncle.”\\n\\n“But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married\\nvery soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.”\\n\\n“Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of\\n_his_.”\\n\\n“But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne’s. I am almost sure it is, for I\\nsaw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of\\nthe room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could\\nbe, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took\\nup her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all\\ntumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of\\nwhite paper; and put it into his pocket-book.”\\n\\nFor such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not\\nwithhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance\\nwas in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.\\n\\nMargaret’s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory\\nto her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park,\\nto give the name of the young man who was Elinor’s particular\\nfavourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\\nMargaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, “I must not\\ntell, may I, Elinor?”\\n\\nThis of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.\\nBut the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed\\non a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a\\nstanding joke with Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nMarianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good\\nto the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to\\nMargaret,\\n\\n“Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to\\nrepeat them.”\\n\\n“I never had any conjectures about it,” replied Margaret; “it was you\\nwho told me of it yourself.”\\n\\nThis increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly\\npressed to say something more.\\n\\n“Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,” said Mrs.\\nJennings. “What is the gentleman’s name?”\\n\\n“I must not tell, ma’am. But I know very well what it is; and I know\\nwhere he is too.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be\\nsure. He is the curate of the parish I dare say.”\\n\\n“No, _that_ he is not. He is of no profession at all.”\\n\\n“Margaret,” said Marianne with great warmth, “you know that all this is\\nan invention of your own, and that there is no such person in\\nexistence.”\\n\\n“Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such\\na man once, and his name begins with an F.”\\n\\nMost grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this\\nmoment, “that it rained very hard,” though she believed the\\ninterruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her\\nladyship’s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as\\ndelighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was\\nimmediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion\\nmindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of\\nrain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked\\nMarianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of\\ndifferent people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so\\neasily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.\\n\\nA party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a\\nvery fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a\\nbrother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not\\nbe seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders\\non that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir\\nJohn, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be\\na tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least,\\ntwice every summer for the last ten years. They contained a noble piece\\nof water; a sail on which was to form a great part of the morning’s\\namusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be\\nemployed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete\\nparty of pleasure.\\n\\nTo some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,\\nconsidering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the\\nlast fortnight;—and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was\\npersuaded by Elinor to stay at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\\nTheir intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from\\nwhat Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through, fatigued,\\nand frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did\\nnot go at all.\\n\\nBy ten o’clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they\\nwere to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had\\nrained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,\\nand the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and good\\nhumour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the greatest\\ninconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.\\n\\nWhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the\\nrest there was one for Colonel Brandon;—he took it, looked at the\\ndirection, changed colour, and immediately left the room.\\n\\n“What is the matter with Brandon?” said Sir John.\\n\\nNobody could tell.\\n\\n“I hope he has had no bad news,” said Lady Middleton. “It must be\\nsomething extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my\\nbreakfast table so suddenly.”\\n\\nIn about five minutes he returned.\\n\\n“No bad news, Colonel, I hope;” said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he\\nentered the room.\\n\\n“None at all, ma’am, I thank you.”\\n\\n“Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is\\nworse.”\\n\\n“No, ma’am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.”\\n\\n“But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a\\nletter of business? Come, come, this won’t do, Colonel; so let us hear\\nthe truth of it.”\\n\\n“My dear madam,” said Lady Middleton, “recollect what you are saying.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?” said\\nMrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter’s reproof.\\n\\n“No, indeed, it is not.”\\n\\n“Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well.”\\n\\n“Whom do you mean, ma’am?” said he, colouring a little.\\n\\n“Oh! you know who I mean.”\\n\\n“I am particularly sorry, ma’am,” said he, addressing Lady Middleton,\\n“that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which\\nrequires my immediate attendance in town.”\\n\\n“In town!” cried Mrs. Jennings. “What can you have to do in town at\\nthis time of year?”\\n\\n“My own loss is great,” he continued, “in being obliged to leave so\\nagreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence\\nis necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.”\\n\\nWhat a blow upon them all was this!\\n\\n“But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,” said\\nMarianne, eagerly, “will it not be sufficient?”\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n“We must go,” said Sir John.—“It shall not be put off when we are so\\nnear it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.”\\n\\n“I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to\\ndelay my journey for one day!”\\n\\n“If you would but let us know what your business is,” said Mrs.\\nJennings, “we might see whether it could be put off or not.”\\n\\n“You would not be six hours later,” said Willoughby, “if you were to\\ndefer your journey till our return.”\\n\\n“I cannot afford to lose _one_ hour.”\\n\\nElinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, “There\\nare some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of\\nthem. He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this\\ntrick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was\\nof his own writing.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt of it,” replied Marianne.\\n\\n“There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of\\nold,” said Sir John, “when once you are determined on anything. But,\\nhowever, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the two\\nMiss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked up\\nfrom the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual\\ntime, on purpose to go to Whitwell.”\\n\\nColonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of\\ndisappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be\\nunavoidable.\\n\\n“Well, then, when will you come back again?”\\n\\n“I hope we shall see you at Barton,” added her ladyship, “as soon as\\nyou can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to\\nWhitwell till you return.”\\n\\n“You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in\\nmy power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.”\\n\\n“Oh! he must and shall come back,” cried Sir John. “If he is not here\\nby the end of the week, I shall go after him.”\\n\\n“Ay, so do, Sir John,” cried Mrs. Jennings, “and then perhaps you may\\nfind out what his business is.”\\n\\n“I do not want to pry into other men’s concerns. I suppose it is\\nsomething he is ashamed of.”\\n\\nColonel Brandon’s horses were announced.\\n\\n“You do not go to town on horseback, do you?” added Sir John.\\n\\n“No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post.”\\n\\n“Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you\\nhad better change your mind.”\\n\\n“I assure you it is not in my power.”\\n\\nHe then took leave of the whole party.\\n\\n“Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this\\nwinter, Miss Dashwood?”\\n\\n“I am afraid, none at all.”\\n\\n“Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to\\ndo.”\\n\\nTo Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.\\n\\n“Come Colonel,” said Mrs. Jennings, “before you go, do let us know what\\nyou are going about.”\\n\\nHe wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.\\n\\nThe complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto\\nrestrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and\\nagain how provoking it was to be so disappointed.\\n\\n“I can guess what his business is, however,” said Mrs. Jennings\\nexultingly.\\n\\n“Can you, ma’am?” said almost every body.\\n\\n“Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.”\\n\\n“And who is Miss Williams?” asked Marianne.\\n\\n“What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have\\nheard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel’s, my dear; a\\nvery near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the\\nyoung ladies.” Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\\n“She is his natural daughter.”\\n\\n“Indeed!”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel will\\nleave her all his fortune.”\\n\\nWhen Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret\\non so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as\\nthey were all got together, they must do something by way of being\\nhappy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although\\nhappiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\\ntolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The carriages\\nwere then ordered; Willoughby’s was first, and Marianne never looked\\nhappier than when she got into it. He drove through the park very fast,\\nand they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them was seen till\\ntheir return, which did not happen till after the return of all the\\nrest. They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said only in\\ngeneral terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others went on\\nthe downs.\\n\\nIt was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\\nevery body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the\\nCareys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly\\ntwenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.\\nWilloughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\\nMrs. Jennings sat on Elinor’s right hand; and they had not been long\\nseated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to\\nMarianne, loud enough for them both to hear, “I have found you out in\\nspite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.”\\n\\nMarianne coloured, and replied very hastily, “Where, pray?”\\n\\n“Did not you know,” said Willoughby, “that we had been out in my\\ncurricle?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined\\nto find out _where_ you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss\\nMarianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I\\nhope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I\\nwas there six years ago.”\\n\\nMarianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed\\nheartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\\nhad been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\\nWilloughby’s groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\\nthey had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\\nwalking about the garden and going all over the house.\\n\\nElinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely\\nthat Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house\\nwhile Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest\\nacquaintance.\\n\\nAs soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\\nand great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance\\nrelated by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry\\nwith her for doubting it.\\n\\n“Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\\ndid not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do\\nyourself?”\\n\\n“Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with\\nno other companion than Mr. Willoughby.”\\n\\n“Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show\\nthat house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to\\nhave any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter morning in my\\nlife.”\\n\\n“I am afraid,” replied Elinor, “that the pleasantness of an employment\\ndoes not always evince its propriety.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if\\nthere had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been\\nsensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting\\nwrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.”\\n\\n“But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very\\nimpertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of\\nyour own conduct?”\\n\\n“If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of\\nimpropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.\\nI value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation. I\\nam not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.\\nSmith’s grounds, or in seeing her house. They will one day be Mr.\\nWilloughby’s, and—”\\n\\n“If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be\\njustified in what you have done.”\\n\\nShe blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;\\nand after a ten minutes’ interval of earnest thought, she came to her\\nsister again, and said with great good humour, “Perhaps, Elinor, it\\n_was_ rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby\\nwanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house, I\\nassure you.—There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a\\nnice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it\\nwould be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.\\nOn one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a\\nbeautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church\\nand village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so\\noften admired. I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more\\nforlorn than the furniture,—but if it were newly fitted up—a couple of\\nhundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest\\nsummer-rooms in England.”\\n\\nCould Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,\\nshe would have described every room in the house with equal delight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n\\nThe sudden termination of Colonel Brandon’s visit at the park, with his\\nsteadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the\\nwonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great\\nwonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all\\nthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with\\nlittle intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must\\nbe some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could\\nhave befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape\\nthem all.\\n\\n“Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,” said she. “I\\ncould see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may\\nbe bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two\\nthousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do\\nthink he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can\\nit be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know the\\ntruth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare\\nsay it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her. May be\\nshe is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a\\nnotion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is about\\nMiss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his\\ncircumstances _now_, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must\\nhave cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can be! May be\\nhis sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over. His setting\\noff in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him out of all his\\ntrouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.”\\n\\nSo wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every\\nfresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.\\nElinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel\\nBrandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,\\nwhich Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the\\ncircumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or\\nvariety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of. It was\\nengrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on\\nthe subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them\\nall. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange\\nand more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not\\nopenly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\\nbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not\\nimagine.\\n\\nShe could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in\\ntheir power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason\\nto believe him rich. His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six\\nor seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that\\nincome could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of\\nhis poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them\\nrelative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,\\nshe could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their\\ngeneral opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind\\nof their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her\\nmaking any inquiry of Marianne.\\n\\nNothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than\\nWilloughby’s behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing\\ntenderness which a lover’s heart could give, and to the rest of the\\nfamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The\\ncottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more\\nof his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general\\nengagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him\\nout in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest\\nof the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet.\\n\\nOne evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the\\ncountry, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of\\nattachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood’s happening\\nto mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly\\nopposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as\\nperfect with him.\\n\\n“What!” he exclaimed—“Improve this dear cottage! No. _That_ I will\\nnever consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch\\nto its size, if my feelings are regarded.”\\n\\n“Do not be alarmed,” said Miss Dashwood, “nothing of the kind will be\\ndone; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.”\\n\\n“I am heartily glad of it,” he cried. “May she always be poor, if she\\ncan employ her riches no better.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not\\nsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one\\nwhom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it\\nthat whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in\\nthe spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it\\nin a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this\\nplace as to see no defect in it?”\\n\\n“I am,” said he. “To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as\\nthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I\\nrich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in\\nthe exact plan of this cottage.”\\n\\n“With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,” said\\nElinor.\\n\\n“Yes,” cried he in the same eager tone, “with all and every thing\\nbelonging to it;—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,\\nshould the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under\\nsuch a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at\\nBarton.”\\n\\n“I flatter myself,” replied Elinor, “that even under the disadvantage\\nof better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your\\nown house as faultless as you now do this.”\\n\\n“There certainly are circumstances,” said Willoughby, “which might\\ngreatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of\\nmy affection, which no other can possibly share.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were\\nfixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she\\nunderstood him.\\n\\n“How often did I wish,” added he, “when I was at Allenham this time\\ntwelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within\\nview of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one\\nshould live in it. How little did I then think that the very first news\\nI should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would\\nbe that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction\\nand interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of\\nwhat happiness I should experience from it, can account for. Must it\\nnot have been so, Marianne?” speaking to her in a lowered voice. Then\\ncontinuing his former tone, he said, “And yet this house you would\\nspoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary\\nimprovement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first\\nbegan, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us\\ntogether, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and\\nevery body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto\\ncontained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any\\nother apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could\\npossibly afford.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should\\nbe attempted.\\n\\n“You are a good woman,” he warmly replied. “Your promise makes me easy.\\nExtend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me that not\\nonly your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you\\nand yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always\\nconsider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to\\nyou so dear to me.”\\n\\nThe promise was readily given, and Willoughby’s behaviour during the\\nwhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.\\n\\n“Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?” said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was\\nleaving them. “I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must\\nwalk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.”\\n\\nHe engaged to be with them by four o’clock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood’s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and\\ntwo of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from\\nbeing of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her\\nmother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the\\nnight before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly\\nsatisfied with her remaining at home.\\n\\nOn their return from the park they found Willoughby’s curricle and\\nservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that\\nher conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had foreseen;\\nbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her\\nto expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came\\nhastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her\\nhandkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\\nSurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\\njust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against\\nthe mantel-piece with his back towards them. He turned round on their\\ncoming in, and his countenance showed that he strongly partook of the\\nemotion which over-powered Marianne.\\n\\n“Is anything the matter with her?” cried Mrs. Dashwood as she\\nentered—“is she ill?”\\n\\n“I hope not,” he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced\\nsmile presently added, “It is I who may rather expect to be ill—for I\\nam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!”\\n\\n“Disappointment?”\\n\\n“Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has\\nthis morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent\\ncousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my\\ndispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\\nexhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.”\\n\\n“To London!—and are you going this morning?”\\n\\n“Almost this moment.”\\n\\n“This is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;—and her\\nbusiness will not detain you from us long I hope.”\\n\\nHe coloured as he replied, “You are very kind, but I have no idea of\\nreturning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are\\nnever repeated within the twelvemonth.”\\n\\n“And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the\\nneighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can\\nyou wait for an invitation here?”\\n\\nHis colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only\\nreplied, “You are too good.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal\\namazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first\\nspoke.\\n\\n“I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\\nwill always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\\nimmediately, because you only can judge how far _that_ might be\\npleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to\\nquestion your judgment than to doubt your inclination.”\\n\\n“My engagements at present,” replied Willoughby, confusedly, “are of\\nsuch a nature—that—I dare not flatter myself—”\\n\\nHe stopped. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another\\npause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint\\nsmile, “It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself\\nany longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible\\nfor me now to enjoy.”\\n\\nHe then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him\\nstep into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\\nparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\\nsudden departure occasioned.\\n\\nElinor’s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother’s. She thought of\\nwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby’s behaviour\\nin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\\ncheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother’s\\ninvitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,\\ngreatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious design had\\never been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate\\nquarrel had taken place between him and her sister;—the distress in\\nwhich Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could\\nmost reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne’s\\nlove for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\\n\\nBut whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister’s\\naffliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest\\ncompassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability\\nnot merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a\\nduty.\\n\\nIn about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\\nred, her countenance was not uncheerful.\\n\\n“Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,” said she,\\nas she sat down to work, “and with how heavy a heart does he travel?”\\n\\n“It is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\\nof a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\\naffectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice—Gone too without\\nintending to return!—Something more than what he owned to us must have\\nhappened. He did not speak, he did not behave like himself. _You_ must\\nhave seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can they have\\nquarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept\\nyour invitation here?”\\n\\n“It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\\n_that_. He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all\\nover I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\\nfirst seemed strange to me as well as to you.”\\n\\n“Can you, indeed!”\\n\\n“Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but\\nyou, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can—it will not satisfy _you_,\\nI know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it. I am\\npersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves\\nof it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that\\naccount is eager to get him away;—and that the business which she sends\\nhim off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. This is\\nwhat I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware that she _does_\\ndisapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to\\nher his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from\\nhis dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself\\nfrom Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or\\nmay _not_ have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can\\npoint out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory\\nat this. And now, Elinor, what have you to say?”\\n\\n“Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.”\\n\\n“Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.\\nOh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather take\\nevil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for misery for\\nMarianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the\\nlatter. You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave\\nof us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown. And is no\\nallowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by\\nrecent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely\\nbecause they are not certainties? Is nothing due to the man whom we\\nhave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill\\nof? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though\\nunavoidably secret for a while? And, after all, what is it you suspect\\nhim of?”\\n\\n“I can hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is the\\ninevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in\\nhim. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the\\nallowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\\ncandid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have\\nvery sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\\nBut it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\\nonce. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\\nits being practiced by him.”\\n\\n“Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the\\ndeviation is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of what I\\nhave said in his defence?—I am happy—and he is acquitted.”\\n\\n“Not entirely. It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they\\n_are_ engaged) from Mrs. Smith—and if that is the case, it must be\\nhighly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at\\npresent. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.”\\n\\n“Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and\\nMarianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have\\nbeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness.”\\n\\n“I want no proof of their affection,” said Elinor; “but of their\\nengagement I do.”\\n\\n“I am perfectly satisfied of both.”\\n\\n“Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of\\nthem.”\\n\\n“I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has\\nnot his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last\\nfortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future\\nwife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?\\nHave we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been\\ndaily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate\\nrespect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How could\\nsuch a thought occur to you? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby,\\npersuaded as he must be of your sister’s love, should leave her, and\\nleave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his\\naffection;—that they should part without a mutual exchange of\\nconfidence?”\\n\\n“I confess,” replied Elinor, “that every circumstance except _one_ is\\nin favour of their engagement; but that _one_ is the total silence of\\nboth on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.”\\n\\n“How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,\\nif, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the\\nnature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a\\npart in his behaviour to your sister all this time? Do you suppose him\\nreally indifferent to her?”\\n\\n“No, I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure.”\\n\\n“But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such\\nindifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this\\nmatter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are\\nfainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. If we\\nfind they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.”\\n\\n“A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you\\nwould suppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But _I_\\nrequire no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify\\ndoubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and\\nunreserved. You cannot doubt your sister’s wishes. It must be\\nWilloughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of\\nhonour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to\\ncreate alarm? can he be deceitful?”\\n\\n“I hope not, I believe not,” cried Elinor. “I love Willoughby,\\nsincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more\\npainful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will not\\nencourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morning;—he did not speak like himself, and did not return\\nyour kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be explained by\\nsuch a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He had just\\nparted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest\\naffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.\\nSmith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware\\nthat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for\\nsome time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by\\nour family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a case,\\na plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his\\nhonour I think, as well as more consistent with his general\\ncharacter;—but I will not raise objections against any one’s conduct on\\nso illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or\\na deviation from what I may think right and consistent.”\\n\\n“You speak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be\\nsuspected. Though _we_ have not known him long, he is no stranger in\\nthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?\\nHad he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging\\neverything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an engagement\\nin some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage must be at\\na very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be\\nobserved, may now be very advisable.”\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then\\nat liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to\\nacknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.\\n\\nThey saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the\\nroom and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes\\nwere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then\\nrestrained with difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could\\nneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother’s silently\\npressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude\\nwas quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.\\n\\nThis violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She was\\nwithout any power, because she was without any desire of command over\\nherself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most\\nanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they\\nspoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings\\nconnected with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\nMarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able\\nto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She\\nwould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next\\nmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than\\nwhen she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a\\ndisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the\\nwhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with a\\nheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all\\nattempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent enough!\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about\\nthe village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment\\nand crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.\\n\\nThe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She played\\nover every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,\\nevery air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at\\nthe instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out\\nfor her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be\\ngained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied. She spent\\nwhole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice\\noften totally suspended by her tears. In books too, as well as in\\nmusic, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and\\npresent was certain of giving. She read nothing but what they had been\\nused to read together.\\n\\nSuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it\\nsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,\\nto which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,\\nstill produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.\\n\\nNo letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.\\nHer mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.\\nDashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at\\nleast satisfied herself.\\n\\n“Remember, Elinor,” said she, “how very often Sir John fetches our\\nletters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already\\nagreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it\\ncould not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through\\nSir John’s hands.”\\n\\nElinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a\\nmotive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so\\ndirect, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real\\nstate of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she\\ncould not help suggesting it to her mother.\\n\\n“Why do you not ask Marianne at once,” said she, “whether she is or she\\nis not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind, so\\nindulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would be\\nthe natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all\\nunreserve, and to you more especially.”\\n\\n“I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible\\nthat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry\\ninflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never\\ndeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of\\nwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know\\nMarianne’s heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not\\nbe the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make\\nthe revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the\\nconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty\\nwould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.”\\n\\nElinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister’s\\nyouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common\\ncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood’s romantic\\ndelicacy.\\n\\nIt was several days before Willoughby’s name was mentioned before\\nMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were\\nnot so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;—but\\none evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of\\nShakespeare, exclaimed,\\n\\n“We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away\\nbefore we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he comes\\nagain...But it may be months, perhaps, before _that_ happens.”\\n\\n“Months!” cried Marianne, with strong surprise. “No—nor many weeks.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor\\npleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of\\nconfidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.\\n\\nOne morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was\\nprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\\nwandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\\ncompanion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the downs,\\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the\\nvalley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be\\nfound when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the\\nexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\\nThey walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\\nfor Marianne’s _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied\\nwith gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the\\nentrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less\\nwild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled\\non first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,\\nthey stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed\\nthe distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had\\nnever happened to reach in any of their walks before.\\n\\nAmongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;\\nit was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes they\\ncould distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards\\nMarianne rapturously exclaimed,\\n\\n“It is he; it is indeed;—I know it is!”—and was hastening to meet him,\\nwhen Elinor cried out,\\n\\n“Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The\\nperson is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.”\\n\\n“He has, he has,” cried Marianne, “I am sure he has. His air, his coat,\\nhis horse. I knew how soon he would come.”\\n\\nShe walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from\\nparticularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,\\nquickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon within thirty\\nyards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within\\nher; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices\\nof both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well\\nknown as Willoughby’s, joined them in begging her to stop, and she\\nturned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.\\n\\nHe was the only person in the world who could at that moment be\\nforgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a\\nsmile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_, and in\\nher sister’s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\\n\\nHe dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with\\nthem to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.\\n\\nHe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by\\nMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than\\neven Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward\\nand her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness\\nwhich she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. On\\nEdward’s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a\\nlover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was confused,\\nseemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither\\nrapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by\\nquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne\\nsaw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a\\ndislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by\\ncarrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\\ncontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\\n\\nAfter a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries\\nof meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No,\\nhe had been in Devonshire a fortnight.\\n\\n“A fortnight!” she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same\\ncounty with Elinor without seeing her before.\\n\\nHe looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with\\nsome friends near Plymouth.\\n\\n“Have you been lately in Sussex?” said Elinor.\\n\\n“I was at Norland about a month ago.”\\n\\n“And how does dear, dear Norland look?” cried Marianne.\\n\\n“Dear, dear Norland,” said Elinor, “probably looks much as it always\\ndoes at this time of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with\\ndead leaves.”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Marianne, “with what transporting sensation have I formerly\\nseen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven\\nin showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they, the season,\\nthe air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard them. They\\nare seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as\\npossible from the sight.”\\n\\n“It is not every one,” said Elinor, “who has your passion for dead\\nleaves.”\\n\\n“No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But\\n_sometimes_ they are.”—As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a\\nfew moments;—but rousing herself again, “Now, Edward,” said she,\\ncalling his attention to the prospect, “here is Barton valley. Look up\\nto it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever\\nsee their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and\\nplantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that\\nfarthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.”\\n\\n“It is a beautiful country,” he replied; “but these bottoms must be\\ndirty in winter.”\\n\\n“How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?”\\n\\n“Because,” replied he, smiling, “among the rest of the objects before\\nme, I see a very dirty lane.”\\n\\n“How strange!” said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\\n\\n“Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant\\npeople?”\\n\\n“No, not all,” answered Marianne; “we could not be more unfortunately\\nsituated.”\\n\\n“Marianne,” cried her sister, “how can you say so? How can you be so\\nunjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us\\nhave behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne, how\\nmany pleasant days we have owed to them?”\\n\\n“No,” said Marianne, in a low voice, “nor how many painful moments.”\\n\\nElinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their\\nvisitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by\\ntalking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting\\nfrom him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to\\nregulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she\\navoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him\\nas she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his\\ncoming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.\\nHer joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received\\nthe kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he\\nentered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating\\nmanners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love\\nwith either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and\\nElinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like\\nhimself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his\\ninterest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was not in\\nspirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was\\nattentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family\\nperceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of\\nliberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents.\\n\\n“What are Mrs. Ferrars’s views for you at present, Edward?” said she,\\nwhen dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; “are you still\\nto be a great orator in spite of yourself?”\\n\\n“No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than\\ninclination for a public life!”\\n\\n“But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to\\nsatisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no\\naffection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find\\nit a difficult matter.”\\n\\n“I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have\\nevery reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced\\ninto genius and eloquence.”\\n\\n“You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate.”\\n\\n“As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as\\nwell as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body\\nelse it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so.”\\n\\n“Strange that it would!” cried Marianne. “What have wealth or grandeur\\nto do with happiness?”\\n\\n“Grandeur has but little,” said Elinor, “but wealth has much to do with\\nit.”\\n\\n“Elinor, for shame!” said Marianne, “money can only give happiness\\nwhere there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can\\nafford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Elinor, smiling, “we may come to the same point. _Your_\\ncompetence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without\\nthem, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of\\nexternal comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than\\nmine. Come, what is your competence?”\\n\\n“About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that_.”\\n\\nElinor laughed. “_two_ thousand a year! _one_ is my wealth! I guessed\\nhow it would end.”\\n\\n“And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,” said Marianne.\\n“A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure I am not\\nextravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of servants, a\\ncarriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.”\\n\\nElinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their\\nfuture expenses at Combe Magna.\\n\\n“Hunters!” repeated Edward—“but why must you have hunters? Every body\\ndoes not hunt.”\\n\\nMarianne coloured as she replied, “But most people do.”\\n\\n“I wish,” said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, “that somebody\\nwould give us all a large fortune apiece!”\\n\\n“Oh that they would!” cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with\\nanimation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary\\nhappiness.\\n\\n“We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,” said Elinor, “in spite\\nof the insufficiency of wealth.”\\n\\n“Oh dear!” cried Margaret, “how happy I should be! I wonder what I\\nshould do with it!”\\n\\nMarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.\\n\\n“I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,” said Mrs.\\nDashwood, “if my children were all to be rich without my help.”\\n\\n“You must begin your improvements on this house,” observed Elinor, “and\\nyour difficulties will soon vanish.”\\n\\n“What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,” said\\nEdward, “in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,\\nmusic-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a\\ngeneral commission for every new print of merit to be sent you—and as\\nfor Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music\\nenough in London to content her. And books!—Thomson, Cowper, Scott—she\\nwould buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I\\nbelieve, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would\\nhave every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree.\\nShould not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very saucy. But I was\\nwilling to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes.”\\n\\n“I love to be reminded of the past, Edward—whether it be melancholy or\\ngay, I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of\\nformer times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspent—some of it, at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in\\nimproving my collection of music and books.”\\n\\n“And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the\\nauthors or their heirs.”\\n\\n“No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who\\nwrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever\\nbe in love more than once in their life—your opinion on that point is\\nunchanged, I presume?”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is\\nnot likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.”\\n\\n“Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,” said Elinor, “she is not\\nat all altered.”\\n\\n“She is only grown a little more grave than she was.”\\n\\n“Nay, Edward,” said Marianne, “_you_ need not reproach me. You are not\\nvery gay yourself.”\\n\\n“Why should you think so!” replied he, with a sigh. “But gaiety never\\nwas a part of _my_ character.”\\n\\n“Nor do I think it a part of Marianne’s,” said Elinor; “I should hardly\\ncall her a lively girl—she is very earnest, very eager in all she\\ndoes—sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation—but she is\\nnot often really merry.”\\n\\n“I believe you are right,” he replied, “and yet I have always set her\\ndown as a lively girl.”\\n\\n“I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,” said\\nElinor, “in a total misapprehension of character in some point or\\nother: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or\\nstupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the\\ndeception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of\\nthemselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.”\\n\\n“But I thought it was right, Elinor,” said Marianne, “to be guided\\nwholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were\\ngiven us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has\\nalways been your doctrine, I am sure.”\\n\\n“No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of\\nthe understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the\\nbehaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of\\nhaving often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with\\ngreater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their\\nsentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?”\\n\\n“You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of\\ngeneral civility,” said Edward to Elinor, “Do you gain no ground?”\\n\\n“Quite the contrary,” replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.\\n\\n“My judgment,” he returned, “is all on your side of the question; but I\\nam afraid my practice is much more on your sister’s. I never wish to\\noffend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I\\nam only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought\\nthat I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I\\nam so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!”\\n\\n“Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,” said\\nElinor.\\n\\n“She knows her own worth too well for false shame,” replied Edward.\\n“Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or\\nother. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy\\nand graceful, I should not be shy.”\\n\\n“But you would still be reserved,” said Marianne, “and that is worse.”\\n\\nEdward started—“Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?”\\n\\n“Yes, very.”\\n\\n“I do not understand you,” replied he, colouring. “Reserved!—how, in\\nwhat manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?”\\n\\nElinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the\\nsubject, she said to him, “Do not you know my sister well enough to\\nunderstand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one reserved\\nwho does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously\\nas herself?”\\n\\nEdward made no answer. His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him\\nin their fullest extent—and he sat for some time silent and dull.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\nElinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His\\nvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own\\nenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was\\nunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished\\nher by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of\\ninspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very\\nuncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\\none moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.\\n\\nHe joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning\\nbefore the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to\\npromote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to\\nthemselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour\\ndoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself\\ncome out.\\n\\n“I am going into the village to see my horses,” said he, “as you are\\nnot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.”\\n\\n\\nEdward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding\\ncountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the\\nvalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation\\nthan the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had\\nexceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured Marianne’s\\nattention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of\\nthese scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had\\nparticularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, “You\\nmust not enquire too far, Marianne—remember I have no knowledge in the\\npicturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste\\nif we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be\\nbold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and\\nrugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be\\nsatisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very\\nfine country—the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,\\nand the valley looks comfortable and snug—with rich meadows and several\\nneat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea\\nof a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility—and I dare say\\nit is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily\\nbelieve it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush\\nwood, but these are all lost on me. I know nothing of the picturesque.”\\n\\n“I am afraid it is but too true,” said Marianne; “but why should you\\nboast of it?”\\n\\n“I suspect,” said Elinor, “that to avoid one kind of affectation,\\nEdward here falls into another. Because he believes many people pretend\\nto more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and\\nis disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and\\nless discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. He is\\nfastidious and will have an affectation of his own.”\\n\\n“It is very true,” said Marianne, “that admiration of landscape scenery\\nis become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries to\\ndescribe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I\\nhave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to\\ndescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and\\nmeaning.”\\n\\n“I am convinced,” said Edward, “that you really feel all the delight in\\na fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister\\nmust allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect,\\nbut not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted,\\nblasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and\\nflourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I am not fond of\\nnettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more pleasure in a snug\\nfarm-house than a watch-tower—and a troop of tidy, happy villagers\\nplease me better than the finest banditti in the world.”\\n\\nMarianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her\\nsister. Elinor only laughed.\\n\\nThe subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained\\nthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.\\nShe was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,\\nhis hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\\nof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.\\n\\n“I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,” she cried. “Is that\\nFanny’s hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I should\\nhave thought her hair had been darker.”\\n\\nMarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt—but when she saw\\nhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought\\ncould not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and giving a\\nmomentary glance at Elinor, replied, “Yes; it is my sister’s hair. The\\nsetting always casts a different shade on it, you know.”\\n\\nElinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair\\nwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;\\nthe only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne\\nconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\\nhave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself. She\\nwas not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting\\nto take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of something\\nelse, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity\\nof eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt, that it\\nwas exactly the shade of her own.\\n\\nEdward’s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of\\nmind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning.\\nMarianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own\\nforgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little\\noffence it had given her sister.\\n\\nBefore the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.\\nJennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the\\ncottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of his\\nmother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of\\nFerrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery\\nagainst the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their\\nacquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately\\nsprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant\\nlooks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret’s instructions,\\nextended.\\n\\nSir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to\\ndine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.\\nOn the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,\\ntowards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished\\nto engage them for both.\\n\\n“You _must_ drink tea with us to night,” said he, “for we shall be\\nquite alone—and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall\\nbe a large party.”\\n\\nMrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. “And who knows but you may raise\\na dance,” said she. “And that will tempt _you_, Miss Marianne.”\\n\\n“A dance!” cried Marianne. “Impossible! Who is to dance?”\\n\\n“Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.—What!\\nyou thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be\\nnameless is gone!”\\n\\n“I wish with all my soul,” cried Sir John, “that Willoughby were among\\nus again.”\\n\\nThis, and Marianne’s blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. “And who\\nis Willoughby?” said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he\\nwas sitting.\\n\\nShe gave him a brief reply. Marianne’s countenance was more\\ncommunicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of\\nothers, but such of Marianne’s expressions as had puzzled him before;\\nand when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and\\nsaid, in a whisper, “I have been guessing. Shall I tell you my guess?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Shall I tell you?”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.”\\n\\nMarianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at\\nthe quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment’s silence, said,\\n\\n“Oh, Edward! How can you?—But the time will come I hope...I am sure you\\nwill like him.”\\n\\n“I do not doubt it,” replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness\\nand warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her\\nacquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing\\nbetween Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to\\nmention it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\nEdward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.\\nDashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on\\nself-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\\namong his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two\\nor three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved—he grew\\nmore and more partial to the house and environs—never spoke of going\\naway without a sigh—declared his time to be wholly disengaged—even\\ndoubted to what place he should go when he left them—but still, go he\\nmust. Never had any week passed so quickly—he could hardly believe it\\nto be gone. He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which\\nmarked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions. He had\\nno pleasure at Norland; he detested being in town; but either to\\nNorland or London, he must go. He valued their kindness beyond any\\nthing, and his greatest happiness was in being with them. Yet, he must\\nleave them at the end of a week, in spite of their wishes and his own,\\nand without any restraint on his time.\\n\\nElinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\\nmother’s account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose\\ncharacter was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\\nfor every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however,\\nand vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain\\nbehaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard\\nhis actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\\nwhich had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for\\nWilloughby’s service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of openness,\\nand of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of\\nindependence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars’s disposition\\nand designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\\nin leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same\\ninevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother. The old\\nwell-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,\\nwas the cause of all. She would have been glad to know when these\\ndifficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,—when Mrs.\\nFerrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy. But\\nfrom such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal\\nof her confidence in Edward’s affection, to the remembrance of every\\nmark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and\\nabove all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round\\nhis finger.\\n\\n“I think, Edward,” said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the\\nlast morning, “you would be a happier man if you had any profession to\\nengage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some\\ninconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it—you would\\nnot be able to give them so much of your time. But (with a smile) you\\nwould be materially benefited in one particular at least—you would know\\nwhere to go when you left them.”\\n\\n“I do assure you,” he replied, “that I have long thought on this point,\\nas you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always be a\\nheavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage\\nme, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like\\nindependence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my\\nfriends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never\\ncould agree in our choice of a profession. I always preferred the\\nchurch, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family.\\nThey recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The\\nlaw was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers\\nin the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and\\ndrove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the\\nlaw, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved.\\nAs for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the\\nsubject was first started to enter it—and, at length, as there was no\\nnecessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing\\nand expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was\\npronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a\\nyoung man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy\\nas to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing. I was\\ntherefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since.”\\n\\n“The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,” said Mrs. Dashwood,\\n“since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will\\nbe brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\\nas Columella’s.”\\n\\n“They will be brought up,” said he, in a serious accent, “to be as\\nunlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in\\nevery thing.”\\n\\n“Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,\\nEdward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike\\nyourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from\\nfriends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\\neducation or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but\\npatience—or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your mother\\nwill secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for;\\nit is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to\\nprevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent. How much may\\nnot a few months do?”\\n\\n“I think,” replied Edward, “that I may defy many months to produce any\\ngood to me.”\\n\\nThis desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\\nMrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which\\nshortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor’s\\nfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.\\nBut as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\\nfrom appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\\ngoing away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\\nMarianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\\nseeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different\\nas their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.\\n\\nElinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\\nhouse, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor\\navoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as\\nmuch as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this\\nconduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\\nsolicitude on her account.\\n\\nSuch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\\nmore meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\\nThe business of self-command she settled very easily;—with strong\\naffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.\\nThat her sister’s affections _were_ calm, she dared not deny, though\\nshe blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave\\na very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in\\nspite of this mortifying conviction.\\n\\nWithout shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in\\ndetermined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to\\nindulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of Edward, and of Edward’s behaviour, in every possible\\nvariety which the different state of her spirits at different times\\ncould produce,—with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.\\nThere were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her\\nmother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,\\nconversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was\\nproduced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not be\\nchained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\\ninteresting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross\\nher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.\\n\\nFrom a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was\\nroused one morning, soon after Edward’s leaving them, by the arrival of\\ncompany. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little\\ngate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew\\nher eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\\ndoor. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,\\nbut there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown\\nto her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John\\nperceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\\nknocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open\\nthe casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the\\ndoor and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one\\nwithout being heard at the other.\\n\\n“Well,” said he, “we have brought you some strangers. How do you like\\nthem?”\\n\\n“Hush! they will hear you.”\\n\\n“Never mind if they do. It is only the Palmers. Charlotte is very\\npretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way.”\\n\\nAs Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without\\ntaking that liberty, she begged to be excused.\\n\\n“Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her\\ninstrument is open.”\\n\\n“She is walking, I believe.”\\n\\nThey were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to\\nwait till the door was opened before she told _her_ story. She came\\nhallooing to the window, “How do you do, my dear? How does Mrs.\\nDashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be\\nglad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son\\nand daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I\\nthought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of\\nnothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so\\nI said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel\\nBrandon come back again—”\\n\\nElinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to\\nreceive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two\\nstrangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same\\ntime, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings\\ncontinued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,\\nattended by Sir John.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally\\nunlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very pretty\\nface, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be. Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister’s,\\nbut they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile, smiled\\nall the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she\\nwent away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and\\ntwenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of\\nless willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the room with a\\nlook of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without\\nspeaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\\napartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read\\nit as long as he staid.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a\\nturn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her\\nadmiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.\\n\\n“Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so\\ncharming! Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last! I\\nalways thought it such a sweet place, ma’am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood)\\nbut you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how delightful\\nevery thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not\\nyou, Mr. Palmer?”\\n\\nMr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the\\nnewspaper.\\n\\n“Mr. Palmer does not hear me,” said she, laughing; “he never does\\nsometimes. It is so ridiculous!”\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to\\nfind wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with\\nsurprise at them both.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and\\ncontinued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\\ntheir friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer\\nlaughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\\nbody agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an\\nagreeable surprise.\\n\\n“You may believe how glad we all were to see them,” added Mrs.\\nJennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice\\nas if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on\\ndifferent sides of the room; “but, however, I can’t help wishing they\\nhad not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,\\nfor they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\\nyou know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\\nwrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\\nmorning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you\\nall!”\\n\\nMrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.\\n\\n“She expects to be confined in February,” continued Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\nLady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and\\ntherefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in\\nthe paper.\\n\\n“No, none at all,” he replied, and read on.\\n\\n“Here comes Marianne,” cried Sir John. “Now, Palmer, you shall see a\\nmonstrous pretty girl.”\\n\\nHe immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and\\nushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she\\nappeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\\nheartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Palmer\\nlooked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\\nthen returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer’s eye was now caught by the\\ndrawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.\\n\\n“Oh! dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look,\\nmama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at\\nthem for ever.” And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that\\nthere were any such things in the room.\\n\\nWhen Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down\\nthe newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.\\n\\n“My love, have you been asleep?” said his wife, laughing.\\n\\nHe made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the\\nroom, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.\\nHe then made his bow, and departed with the rest.\\n\\nSir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at\\nthe park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener\\nthan they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;\\nher daughters might do as they pleased. But they had no curiosity to\\nsee how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\\npleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore,\\nlikewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\\nlikely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied—the carriage\\nshould be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though\\nshe did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\\nPalmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a\\nfamily party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.\\n\\n“Why should they ask us?” said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.\\n“The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very\\nhard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying\\neither with them, or with us.”\\n\\n“They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,” said Elinor, “by\\nthese frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a\\nfew weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are\\ngrown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\nAs the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next\\nday, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as\\ngood humoured and merry as before. She took them all most\\naffectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them\\nagain.\\n\\n“I am so glad to see you!” said she, seating herself between Elinor and\\nMarianne, “for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,\\nwhich would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must\\ngo, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a\\nsudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the\\ncarriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I\\nwould go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any\\nthing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again\\nin town very soon, I hope.”\\n\\nThey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.\\n\\n“Not go to town!” cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, “I shall be quite\\ndisappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in the world\\nfor you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I\\nam sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am\\nconfined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.”\\n\\nThey thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.\\n\\n“Oh, my love,” cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered\\nthe room—“you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town\\nthis winter.”\\n\\nHer love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began\\ncomplaining of the weather.\\n\\n“How horrid all this is!” said he. “Such weather makes every thing and\\nevery body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as\\nwithout, by rain. It makes one detest all one’s acquaintance. What the\\ndevil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house?\\nHow few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the\\nweather.”\\n\\nThe rest of the company soon dropt in.\\n\\n“I am afraid, Miss Marianne,” said Sir John, “you have not been able to\\ntake your usual walk to Allenham today.”\\n\\nMarianne looked very grave and said nothing.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t be so sly before us,” said Mrs. Palmer; “for we know all\\nabout it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think\\nhe is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him in the\\ncountry, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say.”\\n\\n“Much nearer thirty,” said her husband.\\n\\n“Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but\\nthey say it is a sweet pretty place.”\\n\\n“As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,” said Mr. Palmer.\\n\\nMarianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her\\ninterest in what was said.\\n\\n“Is it very ugly?” continued Mrs. Palmer—“then it must be some other\\nplace that is so pretty I suppose.”\\n\\nWhen they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret\\nthat they were only eight all together.\\n\\n“My dear,” said he to his lady, “it is very provoking that we should be\\nso few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?”\\n\\n“Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,\\nthat it could not be done? They dined with us last.”\\n\\n“You and I, Sir John,” said Mrs. Jennings, “should not stand upon such\\nceremony.”\\n\\n“Then you would be very ill-bred,” cried Mr. Palmer.\\n\\n“My love you contradict every body,” said his wife with her usual\\nlaugh. “Do you know that you are quite rude?”\\n\\n“I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother\\nill-bred.”\\n\\n“Ay, you may abuse me as you please,” said the good-natured old lady,\\n“you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again.\\nSo there I have the whip hand of you.”\\n\\nCharlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid\\nof her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,\\nas they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.\\nPalmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her\\nhusband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was\\nhighly diverted.\\n\\n“Mr. Palmer is so droll!” said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. “He is\\nalways out of humour.”\\n\\nElinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit\\nfor being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he\\nwished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by\\nfinding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly woman—but\\nshe knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man\\nto be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of distinction, she\\nbelieved, which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body, and\\nhis general abuse of every thing before him. It was the desire of\\nappearing superior to other people. The motive was too common to be\\nwondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by establishing\\nhis superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to\\nhim except his wife.\\n\\n“Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,” said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, “I have\\ngot such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and\\nspend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,—and come\\nwhile the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!\\nIt will be quite delightful!—My love,” applying to her husband, “don’t\\nyou long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” he replied, with a sneer—“I came into Devonshire with no\\nother view.”\\n\\n“There now,”—said his lady, “you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you\\ncannot refuse to come.”\\n\\nThey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.\\n\\n“But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all\\nthings. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.\\nYou cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay\\nnow, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I\\nnever saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very\\nfatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.”\\n\\nElinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the\\nhardship of such an obligation.\\n\\n“How charming it will be,” said Charlotte, “when he is in\\nParliament!—won’t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to\\nsee all his letters directed to him with an M.P.—But do you know, he\\nsays, he will never frank for me? He declares he won’t. Don’t you, Mr.\\nPalmer?”\\n\\nMr. Palmer took no notice of her.\\n\\n“He cannot bear writing, you know,” she continued—“he says it is quite\\nshocking.”\\n\\n“No,” said he, “I never said any thing so irrational. Don’t palm all\\nyour abuses of language upon me.”\\n\\n“There now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him!\\nSometimes he won’t speak to me for half a day together, and then he\\ncomes out with something so droll—all about any thing in the world.”\\n\\nShe surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,\\nby asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Elinor; “he seems very agreeable.”\\n\\n“Well—I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant; and\\nMr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell\\nyou, and you can’t think how disappointed he will be if you don’t come\\nto Cleveland.—I can’t imagine why you should object to it.”\\n\\nElinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the\\nsubject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable that as\\nthey lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\\nmore particular account of Willoughby’s general character, than could\\nbe gathered from the Middletons’ partial acquaintance with him; and she\\nwas eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as\\nmight remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She began by\\ninquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether\\nthey were intimately acquainted with him.\\n\\n“Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,” replied Mrs. Palmer;—“Not\\nthat I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.\\nSomehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was\\nat Allenham. Mama saw him here once before;—but I was with my uncle at\\nWeymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him\\nin Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we should\\nnever have been in the country together. He is very little at Combe, I\\nbelieve; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer\\nwould visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and besides it\\nis such a way off. I know why you inquire about him, very well; your\\nsister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall\\nhave her for a neighbour you know.”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” replied Elinor, “you know much more of the matter than\\nI do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.”\\n\\n“Don’t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks\\nof. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.”\\n\\n“My dear Mrs. Palmer!”\\n\\n“Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in\\nBond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.”\\n\\n“You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you\\nmust be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not\\nbe interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect\\nColonel Brandon to do.”\\n\\n“But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how\\nit happened. When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and so\\nwe began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,\\nand I said to him, ‘So, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton\\ncottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that\\none of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna. Is\\nit true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in\\nDevonshire so lately.’”\\n\\n“And what did the Colonel say?”\\n\\n“Oh—he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so\\nfrom that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite delightful,\\nI declare! When is it to take place?”\\n\\n“Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?”\\n\\n“Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but\\nsay fine things of you.”\\n\\n“I am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I\\nthink him uncommonly pleasing.”\\n\\n“So do I. He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should\\nbe so grave and so dull. Mama says _he_ was in love with your sister\\ntoo. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly\\never falls in love with any body.”\\n\\n“Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?” said\\nElinor.\\n\\n“Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are\\nacquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all\\nthink him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than\\nMr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She\\nis a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he\\nis much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and\\nagreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don’t\\nthink her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think\\nyou both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,\\nthough we could not get him to own it last night.”\\n\\nMrs. Palmer’s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;\\nbut any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.\\n\\n“I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,” continued Charlotte.—“And\\nnow I hope we shall always be great friends. You can’t think how much I\\nlonged to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the\\ncottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your\\nsister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at\\nCombe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts.”\\n\\n“You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?”\\n\\n“Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He was a particular\\nfriend of Sir John’s. I believe,” she added in a low voice, “he would\\nhave been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady\\nMiddleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good\\nenough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the\\nColonel, and we should have been married immediately.”\\n\\n“Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John’s proposal to your mother\\nbefore it was made? Had he never owned his affection to yourself?”\\n\\n“Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have\\nliked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it was\\nbefore I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr. Palmer is\\nthe kind of man I like.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\n\\nThe Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at\\nBarton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not last\\nlong; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had\\nhardly done wondering at Charlotte’s being so happy without a cause, at\\nMr. Palmer’s acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange\\nunsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir\\nJohn’s and Mrs. Jennings’s active zeal in the cause of society,\\nprocured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.\\n\\nIn a morning’s excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,\\nwhom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her\\nrelations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to\\nthe park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\\nTheir engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an\\ninvitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the\\nreturn of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\\nvisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\\nelegance,—whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for\\nthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\\nnothing at all. Their being her relations too made it so much the\\nworse; and Mrs. Jennings’s attempts at consolation were therefore\\nunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\\ntheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\\ntheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\\nall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely\\ngiving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times\\nevery day.\\n\\nThe young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or\\nunfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,\\nthey were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady\\nMiddleton’s good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had\\nbeen an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable girls\\nindeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir John’s\\nconfidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he\\nset off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss\\nSteeles’ arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\\nin the world. From such commendation as this, however, there was not\\nmuch to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the\\nworld were to be met with in every part of England, under every\\npossible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir John\\nwanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his\\nguests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even to\\nkeep a third cousin to himself.\\n\\n“Do come now,” said he—“pray come—you must come—I declare you shall\\ncome—You can’t think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous pretty,\\nand so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all hanging about\\nher already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they both long to\\nsee you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that you are the\\nmost beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all\\nvery true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted with them I am\\nsure. They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the\\nchildren. How can you be so cross as not to come? Why they are your\\ncousins, you know, after a fashion. _You_ are my cousins, and they are\\nmy wife’s, so you must be related.”\\n\\nBut Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of their\\ncalling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\\namazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\\nattractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the\\nMiss Steeles to them.\\n\\nWhen their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to\\nthese young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the\\neldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible\\nface, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or\\nthree and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features\\nwere pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,\\nwhich though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction\\nto her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what\\nconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable\\nto Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures,\\nextolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their\\nwhims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate\\ndemands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of\\nwhatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,\\nor in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her\\nappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\\nFortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond\\nmother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most\\nrapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands\\nare exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\\naffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were\\nviewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or\\ndistrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent\\nencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\\nShe saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their\\nwork-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt\\nno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other\\nsurprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing.\\n\\n“John is in such spirits today!” said she, on his taking Miss Steeles’s\\npocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window—“He is full of\\nmonkey tricks.”\\n\\nAnd soon afterwards, on the second boy’s violently pinching one of the\\nsame lady’s fingers, she fondly observed, “How playful William is!”\\n\\n“And here is my sweet little Annamaria,” she added, tenderly caressing\\na little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last\\ntwo minutes; “And she is always so gentle and quiet—Never was there\\nsuch a quiet little thing!”\\n\\nBut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship’s\\nhead dress slightly scratching the child’s neck, produced from this\\npattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone\\nby any creature professedly noisy. The mother’s consternation was\\nexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\\nevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\\naffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\\nsufferer. She was seated in her mother’s lap, covered with kisses, her\\nwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\\non her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\\nthe other. With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\\ncease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\\nbrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were\\nineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of\\nsimilar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\\nsuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\\nscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\\nit would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore in\\nher mother’s arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose\\nto follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind,\\nthe four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not\\nknown for many hours.\\n\\n“Poor little creatures!” said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.\\n“It might have been a very sad accident.”\\n\\n“Yet I hardly know how,” cried Marianne, “unless it had been under\\ntotally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of\\nheightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.”\\n\\n“What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!” said Lucy Steele.\\n\\nMarianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not\\nfeel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole\\ntask of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell. She did\\nher best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more\\nwarmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.\\n\\n“And Sir John too,” cried the elder sister, “what a charming man he\\nis!”\\n\\nHere too, Miss Dashwood’s commendation, being only simple and just,\\ncame in without any eclat. She merely observed that he was perfectly\\ngood humoured and friendly.\\n\\n“And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine\\nchildren in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already, and\\nindeed I am always distractedly fond of children.”\\n\\n“I should guess so,” said Elinor, with a smile, “from what I have\\nwitnessed this morning.”\\n\\n“I have a notion,” said Lucy, “you think the little Middletons rather\\ntoo much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is\\nso natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children\\nfull of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and\\nquiet.”\\n\\n“I confess,” replied Elinor, “that while I am at Barton Park, I never\\nthink of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.”\\n\\nA short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss\\nSteele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now\\nsaid rather abruptly, “And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? I\\nsuppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.”\\n\\nIn some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of\\nthe manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.\\n\\n“Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?” added Miss\\nSteele.\\n\\n“We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,” said Lucy, who seemed\\nto think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.\\n\\n“I think every one _must_ admire it,” replied Elinor, “who ever saw the\\nplace; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its\\nbeauties as we do.”\\n\\n“And had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so\\nmany in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast\\naddition always.”\\n\\n“But why should you think,” said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,\\n“that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?”\\n\\n“Nay, my dear, I’m sure I don’t pretend to say that there an’t. I’m\\nsure there’s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could\\nI tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only\\nafraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not\\nso many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may not care\\nabout the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them. For my\\npart, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and\\nbehave civil. But I can’t bear to see them dirty and nasty. Now there’s\\nMr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a beau, clerk\\nto Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of a morning,\\nhe is not fit to be seen. I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss\\nDashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” replied Elinor, “I cannot tell you, for I do not\\nperfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that\\nif he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is\\nnot the smallest alteration in him.”\\n\\n“Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men’s being beaux—they have\\nsomething else to do.”\\n\\n“Lord! Anne,” cried her sister, “you can talk of nothing but beaux;—you\\nwill make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.” And then to\\nturn the discourse, she began admiring the house and the furniture.\\n\\nThis specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. The vulgar freedom and\\nfolly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not\\nblinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want\\nof real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish\\nof knowing them better.\\n\\nNot so the Miss Steeles. They came from Exeter, well provided with\\nadmiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his\\nrelations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair\\ncousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,\\naccomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be\\nbetter acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable\\nlot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,\\ntheir party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of\\nintimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two\\ntogether in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no more;\\nbut he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in\\nhis opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\\nmeeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established\\nfriends.\\n\\nTo do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their\\nunreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew\\nor supposed of his cousins’ situations in the most delicate\\nparticulars; and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the\\neldest of them wished her joy on her sister’s having been so lucky as\\nto make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.\\n\\n“’Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,” said\\nshe, “and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I\\nhope you may have as good luck yourself soon,—but perhaps you may have\\na friend in the corner already.”\\n\\nElinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in\\nproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been\\nwith respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of\\nthe two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since\\nEdward’s visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to\\nher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and\\nwinks, as to excite general attention. The letter F—had been likewise\\ninvariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless\\njokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had\\nbeen long established with Elinor.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these\\njokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the\\nname of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently\\nexpressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family. But Sir John did not sport long with\\nthe curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as much\\npleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.\\n\\n“His name is Ferrars,” said he, in a very audible whisper; “but pray do\\nnot tell it, for it’s a great secret.”\\n\\n“Ferrars!” repeated Miss Steele; “Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?\\nWhat! your sister-in-law’s brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable\\nyoung man to be sure; I know him very well.”\\n\\n“How can you say so, Anne?” cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment\\nto all her sister’s assertions. “Though we have seen him once or twice\\nat my uncle’s, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.”\\n\\nElinor heard all this with attention and surprise. “And who was this\\nuncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?” She wished very\\nmuch to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join in\\nit herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in\\nher life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after\\npetty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. The manner in\\nwhich Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it\\nstruck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion of\\nthat lady’s knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his\\ndisadvantage.—But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice\\nwas taken of Mr. Ferrars’s name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even\\nopenly mentioned by Sir John.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\n\\nMarianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like\\nimpertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of\\ntaste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from\\nthe state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to\\nencourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her\\nbehaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on\\ntheir side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself\\nwhich soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of\\nLucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of\\nstriving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank\\ncommunication of her sentiments.\\n\\nLucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; and\\nas a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable;\\nbut her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and\\nilliterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of\\ninformation in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from\\nMiss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to\\nadvantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities\\nwhich education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with\\nless tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of\\nrectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\\nassiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no\\nlasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity\\nwith ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in\\nconversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made\\nevery show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly\\nvalueless.\\n\\n“You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,” said Lucy to her\\none day, as they were walking together from the park to the\\ncottage—“but pray, are you personally acquainted with your\\nsister-in-law’s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?”\\n\\nElinor _did_ think the question a very odd one, and her countenance\\nexpressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\n“Indeed!” replied Lucy; “I wonder at that, for I thought you must have\\nseen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what\\nsort of a woman she is?”\\n\\n“No,” returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward’s\\nmother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent\\ncuriosity; “I know nothing of her.”\\n\\n“I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a\\nway,” said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; “but perhaps\\nthere may be reasons—I wish I might venture; but however I hope you\\nwill do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be\\nimpertinent.”\\n\\nElinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in\\nsilence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by\\nsaying, with some hesitation,\\n\\n“I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I\\nwould rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person\\nwhose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I\\nshould not have the smallest fear of trusting _you;_ indeed, I should\\nbe very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable\\nsituation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble _you_.\\nI am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.”\\n\\n“I am sorry I do _not_,” said Elinor, in great astonishment, “if it\\ncould be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her. But really I\\nnever understood that you were at all connected with that family, and\\ntherefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry\\ninto her character.”\\n\\n“I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But if\\nI dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs. Ferrars\\nis certainly nothing to me at present—but the time _may_ come—how soon\\nit will come must depend upon herself—when we may be very intimately\\nconnected.”\\n\\nShe looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side\\nglance at her companion to observe its effect on her.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Elinor, “what do you mean? Are you acquainted\\nwith Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?” And she did not feel much\\ndelighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.\\n\\n“No,” replied Lucy, “not to Mr. _Robert_ Ferrars—I never saw him in my\\nlife; but,” fixing her eyes upon Elinor, “to his eldest brother.”\\n\\nWhat felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as\\npainful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the\\nassertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\\nunable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though\\nher complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no\\ndanger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.\\n\\n“You may well be surprised,” continued Lucy; “for to be sure you could\\nhave had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the\\nsmallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always\\nmeant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so\\nby me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne,\\nand I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt the\\ngreatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really\\nthought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars\\nmust seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not think Mr.\\nFerrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I\\nknow he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and\\nlooks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own\\nsisters.”—She paused.\\n\\nElinor for a few moments remained silent. Her astonishment at what she\\nheard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself\\nto speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude—“May I ask\\nif your engagement is of long standing?”\\n\\n“We have been engaged these four years.”\\n\\n“Four years!”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nElinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.\\n\\n“I did not know,” said she, “that you were even acquainted till the\\nother day.”\\n\\n“Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my\\nuncle’s care, you know, a considerable while.”\\n\\n“Your uncle!”\\n\\n“Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?”\\n\\n“I think I have,” replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which\\nincreased with her increase of emotion.\\n\\n“He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near\\nPlymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was\\noften staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\\nformed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\\nwas almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\\nhis mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\\nprudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well as\\nme, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he\\nis very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\\na moment’s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward’s\\nhonour and love, and her companion’s falsehood—“Engaged to Mr. Edward\\nFerrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,\\nthat really—I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of\\nperson or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.”\\n\\n“We can mean no other,” cried Lucy, smiling. “Mr. Edward Ferrars, the\\neldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your\\nsister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow\\nthat I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who\\nall my happiness depends.”\\n\\n“It is strange,” replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, “that I\\nshould never have heard him even mention your name.”\\n\\n“No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has\\nbeen to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,\\nand, therefore, there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my\\nname to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister’s\\nsuspecting any thing, _that_ was reason enough for his not mentioning\\nit.”\\n\\nShe was silent.—Elinor’s security sunk; but her self-command did not\\nsink with it.\\n\\n“Four years you have been engaged,” said she with a firm voice.\\n\\n“Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor\\nEdward! It puts him quite out of heart.” Then taking a small miniature\\nfrom her pocket, she added, “To prevent the possibility of mistake, be\\nso good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be\\nsure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was\\ndrew for.—I have had it above these three years.”\\n\\nShe put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\\npainting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\\nher wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she\\ncould have none of its being Edward’s face. She returned it almost\\ninstantly, acknowledging the likeness.\\n\\n“I have never been able,” continued Lucy, “to give him my picture in\\nreturn, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so\\nanxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first\\nopportunity.”\\n\\n“You are quite in the right,” replied Elinor calmly. They then\\nproceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.\\n\\n“I am sure,” said she, “I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully\\nkeeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to\\nus, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,\\nI dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\\nproud woman.”\\n\\n“I certainly did not seek your confidence,” said Elinor; “but you do me\\nno more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your\\nsecret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\\nunnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being\\nacquainted with it could not add to its safety.”\\n\\nAs she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\\nsomething in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\\npart of what she had been saying; but Lucy’s countenance suffered no\\nchange.\\n\\n“I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,”\\nsaid she, “in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be\\nsure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\\ndescription a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as\\nif you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really\\nthought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular\\ninquiries about Edward’s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have\\nnot a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only person that\\nknows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a\\ngreat deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\\nbetraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must\\nperceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world\\nt’other day, when Edward’s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\\nshould out with it all. You can’t think how much I go through in my\\nmind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I\\nhave suffered for Edward’s sake these last four years. Every thing in\\nsuch suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom—we can hardly\\nmeet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite\\nbroke.”\\n\\nHere she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very\\ncompassionate.\\n\\n“Sometimes.” continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, “I think whether it\\nwould not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.” As\\nshe said this, she looked directly at her companion. “But then at other\\ntimes I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the thoughts\\nof making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such a thing\\nwould do. And on my own account too—so dear as he is to me—I don’t\\nthink I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to do in such a\\ncase, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?”\\n\\n“Pardon me,” replied Elinor, startled by the question; “but I can give\\nyou no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct\\nyou.”\\n\\n“To be sure,” continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both\\nsides, “his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor\\nEdward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful\\nlow-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left us\\nat Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him\\nquite ill.”\\n\\n“Did he come from your uncle’s, then, when he visited us?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he\\ncame directly from town?”\\n\\n“No,” replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh\\ncircumstance in favour of Lucy’s veracity; “I remember he told us, that\\nhe had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.” She\\nremembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing\\nfarther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to\\ntheir names.\\n\\n“Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?” repeated Lucy.\\n\\n“We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.”\\n\\n“I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the\\nmatter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than\\na fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor fellow! I am\\nafraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched\\nspirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;” taking a letter\\nfrom her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. “You\\nknow his hand, I dare say,—a charming one it is; but that is not\\nwritten so well as usual. He was tired, I dare say, for he had just\\nfilled the sheet to me as full as possible.”\\n\\nElinor saw that it _was_ his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This\\npicture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been\\naccidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward’s gift; but a\\ncorrespondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a\\npositive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few\\nmoments, she was almost overcome—her heart sunk within her, and she\\ncould hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she\\nstruggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that\\nher success was speedy, and for the time complete.\\n\\n“Writing to each other,” said Lucy, returning the letter into her\\npocket, “is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, _I_\\nhave one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even\\n_that_. If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. I gave him\\na lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and\\nthat was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.\\nPerhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?”\\n\\n“I did,” said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was\\nconcealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt\\nbefore. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.\\n\\nFortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the\\nconversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a\\nfew minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then\\nat liberty to think and be wretched.\\n\\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\n\\nHowever small Elinor’s general dependence on Lucy’s veracity might be,\\nit was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the\\npresent case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of\\ninventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to\\nbe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported\\nas it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and\\ncontradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their opportunity of\\nacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,\\nat once indisputable and alarming; and Edward’s visit near Plymouth,\\nhis melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,\\nhis uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the\\nMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had\\noften surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed\\naltogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of\\ncondemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality\\ncould set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.—Her resentment of such\\nbehaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time\\nmade her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,\\nsoon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned\\na regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an\\nengagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she\\ncould not believe it such at present. His affection was all her own.\\nShe could not be deceived in that. Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had\\nbeen conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion\\nof her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softener of the heart\\nwas this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her to forgive! He had\\nbeen blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first\\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he\\ncould not be defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he\\ninjured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His\\nimprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have\\ndeprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in\\ntime regain tranquillity; but _he_, what had he to look forward to?\\nCould he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his\\naffection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his\\ndelicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like\\nher—illiterate, artful, and selfish?\\n\\nThe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every\\nthing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding\\nyears—years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the\\nunderstanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,\\nwhile the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society\\nand more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity\\nwhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.\\n\\nIf in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties\\nfrom his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely\\nto be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in\\nconnections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. These\\ndifficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not\\npress very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the\\nperson by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,\\ncould be felt as a relief!\\n\\nAs these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept\\nfor him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of having\\ndone nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the\\nbelief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought\\nshe could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command\\nherself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother\\nand sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,\\nthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first\\nsuffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have\\nsupposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning\\nin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object\\nof her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the\\nperfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly\\npossessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove\\nnear their house.\\n\\nThe necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been\\nentrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing\\nexertion, was no aggravation of Elinor’s distress. On the contrary it\\nwas a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give\\nsuch affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that\\ncondemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of\\ntheir partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt\\nequal to support.\\n\\nFrom their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive\\nno assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,\\nwhile her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their\\nexample nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own good\\nsense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her\\nappearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant\\nand so fresh, it was possible for them to be.\\n\\nMuch as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the\\nsubject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for\\nmore reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their\\nengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what\\nLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her\\ndeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to\\nconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her\\ncalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in\\nit than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary\\nagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least\\ndoubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very\\nprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her\\npraise, not merely from Lucy’s assertion, but from her venturing to\\ntrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so\\nconfessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John’s joking\\nintelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor\\nremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\\nEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\\nnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very\\nconfidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the\\naffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of\\nLucy’s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?\\nShe had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival’s\\nintentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every\\nprinciple of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection\\nfor Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny\\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was\\nunwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on\\nthe subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own\\nability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.\\n\\nBut it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be\\ncommanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take\\nadvantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine\\nenough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most\\neasily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at\\nleast every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at\\nthe former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of\\nconversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady\\nMiddleton’s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for\\na general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. They met for\\nthe sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,\\nor consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\\n\\nOne or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording\\nElinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at\\nthe cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they\\nwould all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to\\nattend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,\\nexcept her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a\\nfairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this\\nwas likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united\\nthem together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the\\ninvitation; Margaret, with her mother’s permission, was equally\\ncompliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their\\nparties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.\\n\\nThe young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from\\nthe frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the\\nmeeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one\\nnovelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting\\nthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and\\ndrawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while\\nthey remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of\\nengaging Lucy’s attention to attempt it. They quitted it only with the\\nremoval of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and Elinor\\nbegan to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of\\nfinding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in\\npreparation for a round game.\\n\\n“I am glad,” said Lady Middleton to Lucy, “you are not going to finish\\npoor little Annamaria’s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt\\nyour eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the dear\\nlittle love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I\\nhope she will not much mind it.”\\n\\nThis hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,\\n“Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting\\nto know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have\\nbeen at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am\\nresolved to finish the basket after supper.”\\n\\n“You are very good, I hope it won’t hurt your eyes—will you ring the\\nbell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly\\ndisappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for\\nthough I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon\\nhaving it done.”\\n\\nLucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an\\nalacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no\\ngreater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\\n\\nLady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made\\nany objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms\\nof general civility, exclaimed, “Your Ladyship will have the goodness\\nto excuse _me_—you know I detest cards. I shall go to the piano-forte;\\nI have not touched it since it was tuned.” And without farther\\nceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\\n\\nLady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that _she_ had never\\nmade so rude a speech.\\n\\n“Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma’am,”\\nsaid Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; “and I do not\\nmuch wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever\\nheard.”\\n\\nThe remaining five were now to draw their cards.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” continued Elinor, “if I should happen to cut out, I may be\\nof some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and\\nthere is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be\\nimpossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I\\nshould like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.”\\n\\n“Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,” cried Lucy,\\n“for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;\\nand it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after\\nall.”\\n\\n“Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,” said Miss Steele. “Dear little\\nsoul, how I do love her!”\\n\\n“You are very kind,” said Lady Middleton to Elinor; “and as you really\\nlike the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till\\nanother rubber, or will you take your chance now?”\\n\\nElinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a\\nlittle of that address which Marianne could never condescend to\\npractise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same\\ntime. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\\nrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at\\nwhich Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\\nby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\\nwas luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\\nsafely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\n\\nIn a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\\n\\n“I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,\\nif I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its\\nsubject. I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” cried Lucy warmly, “for breaking the ice; you have set my\\nheart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended\\nyou by what I told you that Monday.”\\n\\n“Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,” and Elinor spoke\\nit with the truest sincerity, “nothing could be farther from my\\nintention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for\\nthe trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?”\\n\\n“And yet I do assure you,” replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of\\nmeaning, “there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your\\nmanner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was angry\\nwith me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having\\ntook such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am very\\nglad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not blame\\nme. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart\\nspeaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my\\nlife, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am\\nsure.”\\n\\n“Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,\\nto acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall\\nnever have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one;\\nyou seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have\\nneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr.\\nFerrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.”\\n\\n“He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to\\nmarry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect\\nof more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very small income,\\nand could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to\\nbe the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother\\nmight give him if he married to please her. We must wait, it may be for\\nmany years. With almost every other man in the world, it would be an\\nalarming prospect; but Edward’s affection and constancy nothing can\\ndeprive me of I know.”\\n\\n“That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly\\nsupported by the same trust in your’s. If the strength of your\\nreciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under\\nmany circumstances it naturally would during a four years’ engagement,\\nyour situation would have been pitiable, indeed.”\\n\\nLucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance\\nfrom every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.\\n\\n“Edward’s love for me,” said Lucy, “has been pretty well put to the\\ntest, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and\\nit has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt\\nit now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment’s alarm\\non that account from the first.”\\n\\nElinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.\\n\\nLucy went on. “I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from\\nour different situations in life, from his being so much more in the\\nworld than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for\\nsuspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been\\nthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any\\nlowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked\\nmore of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at\\nLongstaple than he used to be. I do not mean to say that I am\\nparticularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case\\nI am sure I could not be deceived.”\\n\\n“All this,” thought Elinor, “is very pretty; but it can impose upon\\nneither of us.”\\n\\n“But what,” said she after a short silence, “are your views? or have\\nyou none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars’s death, which is a\\nmelancholy and shocking extremity?—Is her son determined to submit to\\nthis, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which\\nit may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a\\nwhile by owning the truth?”\\n\\n“If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs.\\nFerrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger\\nupon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and\\nthe idea of that, for Edward’s sake, frightens away all my inclination\\nfor hasty measures.”\\n\\n“And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness\\nbeyond reason.”\\n\\nLucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.\\n\\n“Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?” asked Elinor.\\n\\n“Not at all—I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his\\nbrother—silly and a great coxcomb.”\\n\\n“A great coxcomb!” repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those\\nwords by a sudden pause in Marianne’s music. “Oh, they are talking of\\ntheir favourite beaux, I dare say.”\\n\\n“No sister,” cried Lucy, “you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux\\nare _not_ great coxcombs.”\\n\\n“I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood’s is not,” said Mrs. Jennings,\\nlaughing heartily; “for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved\\nyoung men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little\\ncreature, there is no finding out who _she_ likes.”\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, “I dare\\nsay Lucy’s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss\\nDashwood’s.”\\n\\nElinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked\\nangrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy\\nfirst put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was\\nthen giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent\\nconcerto,—\\n\\n“I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my\\nhead, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into\\nthe secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen\\nenough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other\\nprofession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he\\ncan, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind\\nenough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard\\nto me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;\\nwhich I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not\\nlikely to live a great while. That would be enough for us to marry\\nupon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.”\\n\\n“I should always be happy,” replied Elinor, “to show any mark of my\\nesteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my\\ninterest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is\\nbrother to Mrs. John Dashwood—_that_ must be recommendation enough to\\nher husband.”\\n\\n“But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward’s going into\\norders.”\\n\\n“Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.”\\n\\nThey were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with\\na deep sigh,\\n\\n“I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at\\nonce by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties\\non every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we\\nshould be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your\\nadvice, Miss Dashwood?”\\n\\n“No,” answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated\\nfeelings, “on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well\\nthat my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the\\nside of your wishes.”\\n\\n“Indeed you wrong me,” replied Lucy, with great solemnity; “I know\\nnobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do\\nreally believe, that if you was to say to me, ‘I advise you by all\\nmeans to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be\\nmore for the happiness of both of you,’ I should resolve upon doing it\\nimmediately.”\\n\\nElinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward’s future wife, and\\nreplied, “This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any\\nopinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence much\\ntoo high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too\\nmuch for an indifferent person.”\\n\\n“’Tis because you are an indifferent person,” said Lucy, with some\\npique, and laying a particular stress on those words, “that your\\njudgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be\\nsupposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion\\nwould not be worth having.”\\n\\nElinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might\\nprovoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and\\nwas even partly determined never to mention the subject again. Another\\npause therefore of many minutes’ duration, succeeded this speech, and\\nLucy was still the first to end it.\\n\\n“Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?” said she with all\\nher accustomary complacency.\\n\\n“Certainly not.”\\n\\n“I am sorry for that,” returned the other, while her eyes brightened at\\nthe information, “it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you\\nthere! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your\\nbrother and sister will ask you to come to them.”\\n\\n“It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.”\\n\\n“How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there. Anne\\nand me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have\\nbeen wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go for\\nthe sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise\\nLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.”\\n\\nElinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first\\nrubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore\\nat an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for\\nnothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other\\nless than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table\\nwith the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without\\naffection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not\\neven the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere\\naffection on _her_ side would have given, for self-interest alone could\\ninduce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so\\nthoroughly aware that he was weary.\\n\\nFrom this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when\\nentered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,\\nand was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness\\nwhenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the\\nformer with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility\\nwould allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which\\nLucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.\\n\\nThe visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond\\nwhat the first invitation implied. Their favour increased; they could\\nnot be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of\\ntheir numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the\\nabsolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was\\nin full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay\\nnearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of\\nthat festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private\\nballs and large dinners to proclaim its importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\n\\nThough Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of\\nthe year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without\\na settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her husband, who\\nhad traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she had\\nresided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman\\nSquare. Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to turn\\nher thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very unexpectedly\\nby them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her. Elinor,\\nwithout observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the\\nanimated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave\\na grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself\\nto be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was their\\ndetermined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the\\nyear. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and\\nrepeated her invitation immediately.\\n\\n“Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_\\nbeg you will favour me with your company, for I’ve quite set my heart\\nupon it. Don’t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I\\nshan’t put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be sending\\nBetty by the coach, and I hope I can afford _that_. We three shall be\\nable to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do\\nnot like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one\\nof my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I\\nhave had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that\\nshe will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I\\ndon’t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you,\\nit shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for you to all the\\nyoung men, you may depend upon it.”\\n\\n“I have a notion,” said Sir John, “that Miss Marianne would not object\\nto such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very\\nhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss\\nDashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for\\ntown, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss\\nDashwood about it.”\\n\\n“Nay,” cried Mrs. Jennings, “I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of\\nMiss Marianne’s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the\\nmore the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for\\nthem to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk\\nto one another, and laugh at my odd ways behind my back. But one or the\\nother, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do you\\nthink I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till\\nthis winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let us\\nstrike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her\\nmind by and bye, why so much the better.”\\n\\n“I thank you, ma’am, sincerely thank you,” said Marianne, with warmth:\\n“your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give\\nme such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,\\nto be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,—I\\nfeel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made\\nless happy, less comfortable by our absence—Oh! no, nothing should\\ntempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle.”\\n\\nMrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare\\nthem perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw\\nto what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her\\neagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother’s\\ndecision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any\\nsupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not\\napprove of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had\\nparticular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her\\nmother would be eager to promote—she could not expect to influence the\\nlatter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had\\nnever been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explain\\nthe motive of her own disinclination for going to London. That\\nMarianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.\\nJennings’ manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook\\nevery inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be\\nmost wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,\\nwas such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object\\nto her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to\\nwitness.\\n\\nOn being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such\\nan excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her\\ndaughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to\\nherself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of\\ntheir declining the offer upon _her_ account; insisted on their both\\naccepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual\\ncheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,\\nfrom this separation.\\n\\n“I am delighted with the plan,” she cried, “it is exactly what I could\\nwish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.\\nWhen you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and\\nhappily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret\\nso improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of\\nalteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without\\nany inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you _should_ go to\\ntown; I would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be under\\nthe care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I\\ncan have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your brother,\\nand whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I\\nconsider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged\\nfrom each other.”\\n\\n“Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,” said Elinor, “you\\nhave been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which\\noccurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,\\ncannot be so easily removed.”\\n\\nMarianne’s countenance sunk.\\n\\n“And what,” said Mrs. Dashwood, “is my dear prudent Elinor going to\\nsuggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do not\\nlet me hear a word about the expense of it.”\\n\\n“My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings’s\\nheart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or\\nwhose protection will give us consequence.”\\n\\n“That is very true,” replied her mother, “but of her society,\\nseparately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing\\nat all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady\\nMiddleton.”\\n\\n“If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,” said\\nMarianne, “at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation. I\\nhave no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every\\nunpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.”\\n\\nElinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards\\nthe manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in\\npersuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved\\nwithin herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go\\nlikewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left\\nto the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should\\nbe abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her\\ndomestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily\\nreconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy’s account, was\\nnot to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any\\nunreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.\\n\\n“I will have you _both_ go,” said Mrs. Dashwood; “these objections are\\nnonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and\\nespecially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to\\nanticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of\\nsources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law’s family.”\\n\\nElinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her\\nmother’s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the\\nshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this\\nattack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin\\nher design by saying, as calmly as she could, “I like Edward Ferrars\\nvery much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of\\nthe family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am\\never known to them or not.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in\\nastonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held\\nher tongue.\\n\\nAfter very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the\\ninvitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the\\ninformation with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness\\nand care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was\\ndelighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of\\nbeing alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in\\nLondon, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being\\ndelighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as for\\nthe Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in\\ntheir lives as this intelligence made them.\\n\\nElinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with\\nless reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,\\nit was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and\\nwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her\\nsister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all\\nher usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she\\ncould not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow\\nherself to distrust the consequence.\\n\\nMarianne’s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the\\nperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her\\nunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;\\nand at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive. Her\\nmother’s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the\\nthree, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of\\neternal.\\n\\nTheir departure took place in the first week in January. The Middletons\\nwere to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their station at\\nthe park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\n\\nElinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and\\nbeginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,\\nwithout wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance\\nwith that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and\\ndisposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure\\nonly a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy\\nardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been\\novercome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt\\nof Willoughby’s constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful\\nexpectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of\\nMarianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless\\nher own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would\\nengage in the solicitude of Marianne’s situation to have the same\\nanimating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a very\\nshort time however must now decide what Willoughby’s intentions were;\\nin all probability he was already in town. Marianne’s eagerness to be\\ngone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was\\nresolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character\\nwhich her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such\\nzealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,\\nbefore many meetings had taken place. Should the result of her\\nobservations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open\\nthe eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be\\nof a different nature—she must then learn to avoid every selfish\\ncomparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction\\nin the happiness of Marianne.\\n\\nThey were three days on their journey, and Marianne’s behaviour as they\\ntravelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\\ncompanionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in\\nsilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\\never voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty\\nwithin their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively\\naddressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor\\ntook immediate possession of the post of civility which she had\\nassigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,\\ntalked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she\\ncould; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all\\npossible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and\\nenjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their\\nown dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring\\nsalmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by\\nthree o’clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,\\nfrom the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury\\nof a good fire.\\n\\nThe house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies\\nwere immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment. It\\nhad formerly been Charlotte’s, and over the mantelpiece still hung a\\nlandscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having\\nspent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.\\n\\nAs dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\\narrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\\nmother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\\nthe same. “_I_ am writing home, Marianne,” said Elinor; “had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?”\\n\\n“I am _not_ going to write to my mother,” replied Marianne, hastily,\\nand as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it\\nimmediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and\\nthe conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\\nmysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\\nengaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\\npleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\\nMarianne’s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no\\nmore than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\\neager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\\ndirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\\nbell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed\\nfor her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.\\n\\nHer spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\\nwhich prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\\nagitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\\ndinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\\nanxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\\n\\nIt was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much\\nengaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing. The tea\\nthings were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more\\nthan once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor\\nfelt secure of its announcing Willoughby’s approach, and Marianne,\\nstarting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this could\\nnot be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few steps\\ntowards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned into\\nthe room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him\\nwould naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant\\nshe could not help exclaiming, “Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it\\nis!” and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when\\nColonel Brandon appeared.\\n\\nIt was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately\\nleft the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her\\nregard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt\\nparticularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive\\nthat she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing\\nhim. She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even\\nobserved Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and\\nconcern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded\\ntowards herself.\\n\\n“Is your sister ill?” said he.\\n\\nElinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\\nhead-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which\\nshe could decently attribute her sister’s behaviour.\\n\\nHe heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\\nhimself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\\nhis pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about\\ntheir journey, and the friends they had left behind.\\n\\nIn this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\\nthey continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\\nof both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\\nWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\\nany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,\\nshe asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.\\n“Yes,” he replied, with some embarrassment, “almost ever since; I have\\nbeen once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in\\nmy power to return to Barton.”\\n\\nThis, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\\nher remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\\nthe uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she\\nwas fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the\\nsubject than she had ever felt.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon came in. “Oh! Colonel,” said she, with her usual\\nnoisy cheerfulness, “I am monstrous glad to see you—sorry I could not\\ncome before—beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a\\nlittle, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been\\nat home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do\\nafter one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to\\nsettle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! But\\npray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town\\ntoday?”\\n\\n“I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer’s, where I have been\\ndining.”\\n\\n“Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does\\nCharlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,\\nthat you will certainly see her to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two\\nyoung ladies with me, you see—that is, you see but one of them now, but\\nthere is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too—which you\\nwill not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby\\nwill do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be young and\\nhandsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very handsome—worse\\nluck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I don’t know what\\nthe greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has been dead these\\neight years and better. But Colonel, where have you been to since we\\nparted? And how does your business go on? Come, come, let’s have no\\nsecrets among friends.”\\n\\nHe replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\\nwithout satisfying her in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and\\nMarianne was obliged to appear again.\\n\\nAfter her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\\nthan he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to\\nstay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were\\nunanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\\n\\nMarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\\nThe disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\\nexpectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished\\ntheir breakfast before Mrs. Palmer’s barouche stopped at the door, and\\nin a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\\nthem all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\\nfrom meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at\\ntheir coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\\nalong; so angry at their accepting her mother’s invitation after having\\ndeclined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven\\nthem if they had not come!\\n\\n“Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,” said she; “What do you think\\nhe said when he heard of your coming with Mama? I forget what it was\\nnow, but it was something so droll!”\\n\\nAfter an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\\nor in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\\nacquaintance on Mrs. Jennings’s side, and in laughter without cause on\\nMrs. Palmer’s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all\\naccompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\\nwhich Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\\nsome purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at\\nfirst was induced to go likewise.\\n\\nWherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond\\nStreet especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\\nconstant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind\\nwas equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all\\nthat interested and occupied the others. Restless and dissatisfied\\nevery where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article\\nof purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received\\nno pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and\\ncould with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.\\nPalmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;\\nwho was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\\ntime in rapture and indecision.\\n\\nIt was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had\\nthey entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when\\nElinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful\\ncountenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.\\n\\n“Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?” said she to\\nthe footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the\\nnegative. “Are you quite sure of it?” she replied. “Are you certain\\nthat no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?”\\n\\nThe man replied that none had.\\n\\n“How very odd!” said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\\nturned away to the window.\\n\\n“How odd, indeed!” repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister\\nwith uneasiness. “If she had not known him to be in town she would not\\nhave written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\\nand if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!\\nOh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement\\nbetween a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in\\nso doubtful, so mysterious a manner! _I_ long to inquire; and how will\\n_my_ interference be borne.”\\n\\nShe determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued\\nmany days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in\\nthe strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious\\nenquiry into the affair.\\n\\nMrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings’s intimate\\nacquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with\\nthem. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\\nengagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she would\\nnever learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her own\\ndisposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to\\nher than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation\\nand the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured for a few\\nminutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she returned\\nto the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards\\nacross the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,\\nin hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\n\\n“If this open weather holds much longer,” said Mrs. Jennings, when they\\nmet at breakfast the following morning, “Sir John will not like leaving\\nBarton next week; ’tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day’s\\npleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to\\ntake it so much to heart.”\\n\\n“That is true,” cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the\\nwindow as she spoke, to examine the day. “I had not thought of _that_.\\nThis weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.”\\n\\nIt was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.\\n“It is charming weather for _them_ indeed,” she continued, as she sat\\ndown to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. “How much they\\nmust enjoy it! But” (with a little return of anxiety) “it cannot be\\nexpected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a\\nseries of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts\\nwill soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day\\nor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer—nay,\\nperhaps it may freeze tonight!”\\n\\n“At any rate,” said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from\\nseeing her sister’s thoughts as clearly as she did, “I dare say we\\nshall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next\\nweek.”\\n\\n“Ay, my dear, I’ll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way.”\\n\\n“And now,” silently conjectured Elinor, “she will write to Combe by\\nthis day’s post.”\\n\\nBut if she _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy\\nwhich eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the\\ntruth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\\ncontentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\\nnot be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy\\nin the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of\\na frost.\\n\\nThe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.\\nJennings’s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and\\nMarianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,\\nwatching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the\\nair.\\n\\n“Don’t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There\\nseems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm\\neven in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem\\nparting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear\\nafternoon.”\\n\\nElinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,\\nand saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in\\nthe appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching\\nfrost.\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.\\nJennings’s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her\\nbehaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her\\nhousehold arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and\\nexcepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton’s regret, she\\nhad never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at\\nall discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased to find\\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had\\nexpected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real\\nenjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or\\nabroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\\n\\nColonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with\\nthem almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,\\nwho often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from\\nany other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much\\nconcern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a\\nstrengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which\\nhe often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than\\nwhen at Barton.\\n\\nAbout a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was\\nalso arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the\\nmorning’s drive.\\n\\n“Good God!” cried Marianne, “he has been here while we were out.”\\nElinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to\\nsay, “Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.” But Marianne seemed\\nhardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings’s entrance, escaped with the\\nprecious card.\\n\\nThis event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of\\nher sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this\\nmoment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every\\nhour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on being\\nleft behind, the next morning, when the others went out.\\n\\nElinor’s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street\\nduring their absence; but a moment’s glance at her sister when they\\nreturned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second\\nvisit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.\\n\\n“For me!” cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.\\n\\n“No, ma’am, for my mistress.”\\n\\nBut Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.\\n\\n“It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!”\\n\\n“You are expecting a letter, then?” said Elinor, unable to be longer\\nsilent.\\n\\n“Yes, a little—not much.”\\n\\nAfter a short pause. “You have no confidence in me, Marianne.”\\n\\n“Nay, Elinor, this reproach from _you_—you who have confidence in no\\none!”\\n\\n“Me!” returned Elinor in some confusion; “indeed, Marianne, I have\\nnothing to tell.”\\n\\n“Nor I,” answered Marianne with energy, “our situations then are alike.\\nWe have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not\\ncommunicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.”\\n\\nElinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was\\nnot at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to\\npress for greater openness in Marianne.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it\\naloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\\nStreet the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and\\ncousins the following evening. Business on Sir John’s part, and a\\nviolent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.\\nThe invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew\\nnear, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that\\nthey should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty\\nin persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of\\nWilloughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,\\nthan unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.\\n\\nElinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\\nmaterially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\\nin town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\\nyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,\\nhowever, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an\\nunpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\\nreputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\\nwas risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\\nknown that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\\ncouple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\\nnot seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid\\nthe appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore\\nnever came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their\\nentrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they\\nwere, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the\\nroom. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it\\nwas enough—_he_ was not there—and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to\\nreceive or communicate pleasure. After they had been assembled about an\\nhour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his\\nsurprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first\\ninformed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\\nsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come.\\n\\n“I thought you were both in Devonshire,” said he.\\n\\n“Did you?” replied Elinor.\\n\\n“When do you go back again?”\\n\\n“I do not know.” And thus ended their discourse.\\n\\nNever had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was\\nthat evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She\\ncomplained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.\\n\\n“Aye, aye,” said Mrs. Jennings, “we know the reason of all that very\\nwell; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you\\nwould not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very\\npretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.”\\n\\n“Invited!” cried Marianne.\\n\\n“So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him\\nsomewhere in the street this morning.” Marianne said no more, but\\nlooked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing\\nsomething that might lead to her sister’s relief, Elinor resolved to\\nwrite the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\\nfor the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\\nso long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by\\nperceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again\\nwriting to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other\\nperson.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on\\nbusiness, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too\\nrestless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one\\nwindow to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.\\nElinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all\\nthat had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby’s inconstancy, urging her\\nby every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\\nof her real situation with respect to him.\\n\\nHer letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and\\nColonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the\\nwindow, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he\\nentered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\\nparticular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.\\nElinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\\nsister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the\\nfirst time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than\\nonce before, beginning with the observation of “your sister looks\\nunwell to-day,” or “your sister seems out of spirits,” he had appeared\\non the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something\\nparticular about her. After a pause of several minutes, their silence\\nwas broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was\\nto congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was not\\nprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged\\nto adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant? He\\ntried to smile as he replied, “your sister’s engagement to Mr.\\nWilloughby is very generally known.”\\n\\n“It cannot be generally known,” returned Elinor, “for her own family do\\nnot know it.”\\n\\nHe looked surprised and said, “I beg your pardon, I am afraid my\\ninquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy\\nintended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally\\ntalked of.”\\n\\n“How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?”\\n\\n“By many—by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are\\nmost intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But\\nstill I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps\\nrather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to\\nsupport its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in\\nyour sister’s writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I\\ncould ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it\\nimpossible to—? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of\\nsucceeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in\\nsaying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I\\nhave the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely\\nresolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if\\nconcealment be possible, is all that remains.”\\n\\nThese words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for\\nher sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to say\\nanything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a\\nshort time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The real\\nstate of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known\\nto herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable\\nto say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that Marianne’s\\naffection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon’s\\nsuccess, whatever the event of that affection might be, and at the same\\ntime wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought it most\\nprudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than she really\\nknew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore, that though she had\\nnever been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with\\neach other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and of their\\ncorrespondence she was not astonished to hear.\\n\\nHe listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,\\nrose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,\\n“to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve her,”—took leave, and went away.\\n\\nElinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to\\nlessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the\\ncontrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon’s\\nunhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her\\nanxiety for the very event that must confirm it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\n\\nNothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor\\nregret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby\\nneither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time to\\nattend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept\\naway by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,\\nMarianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming\\nequally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one\\nlook of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the drawing-room\\nfire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton’s arrival, without\\nonce stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude, lost in her own\\nthoughts, and insensible of her sister’s presence; and when at last\\nthey were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door, she\\nstarted as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.\\n\\nThey arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as\\nthe string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the\\nstairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another\\nin an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full\\nof company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their tribute of\\npoliteness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted\\nto mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and\\ninconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some\\ntime spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to\\nCassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and\\nElinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great\\ndistance from the table.\\n\\nThey had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived\\nWilloughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest\\nconversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon\\ncaught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to\\nspeak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;\\nand then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned\\ninvoluntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by\\nher. At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance\\nglowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him\\ninstantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” she exclaimed, “he is there—he is there—Oh! why does he\\nnot look at me? why cannot I speak to him?”\\n\\n“Pray, pray be composed,” cried Elinor, “and do not betray what you\\nfeel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet.”\\n\\nThis however was more than she could believe herself; and to be\\ncomposed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it\\nwas beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which affected\\nevery feature.\\n\\nAt last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,\\nand pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to\\nhim. He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than\\nMarianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe\\nher attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and\\nasked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed of all presence\\nof mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word. But the\\nfeelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her face was crimsoned\\nover, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion, “Good God!\\nWilloughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you not received my\\nletters? Will you not shake hands with me?”\\n\\nHe could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he\\nheld her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was evidently\\nstruggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and saw its\\nexpression becoming more tranquil. After a moment’s pause, he spoke\\nwith calmness.\\n\\n“I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,\\nand very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find\\nyourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope.”\\n\\n“But have you not received my notes?” cried Marianne in the wildest\\nanxiety. “Here is some mistake I am sure—some dreadful mistake. What\\ncan be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven’s sake tell\\nme, what is the matter?”\\n\\nHe made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment\\nreturned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he\\nhad been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,\\nhe recovered himself again, and after saying, “Yes, I had the pleasure\\nof receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so\\ngood as to send me,” turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined\\nhis friend.\\n\\nMarianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into\\nher chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried\\nto screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with\\nlavender water.\\n\\n“Go to him, Elinor,” she cried, as soon as she could speak, “and force\\nhim to come to me. Tell him I must see him again—must speak to him\\ninstantly.—I cannot rest—I shall not have a moment’s peace till this is\\nexplained—some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him this\\nmoment.”\\n\\n“How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is\\nnot the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow.”\\n\\nWith difficulty however could she prevent her from following him\\nherself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,\\nwith the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more\\nprivacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued\\nincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,\\nby exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby\\nquit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne\\nthat he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that\\nevening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She instantly begged\\nher sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was\\ntoo miserable to stay a minute longer.\\n\\nLady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed\\nthat Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her\\nwish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they\\ndeparted as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was\\nspoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a silent\\nagony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was\\nluckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room, where\\nhartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon undressed and\\nin bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her sister then left\\nher, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure\\nenough for thinking over the past.\\n\\nThat some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and\\nMarianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,\\nseemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own\\nwishes, _she_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or\\nmisapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment\\ncould account for it. Her indignation would have been still stronger\\nthan it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to\\nspeak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented her from\\nbelieving him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the\\naffections of her sister from the first, without any design that would\\nbear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and\\nconvenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a\\nregard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.\\n\\nAs for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already\\nhave given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in\\nits probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest\\nconcern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she\\ncould _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in\\nfuture, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance that\\ncould embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of\\nMarianne in a final separation from Willoughby—in an immediate and\\nirreconcilable rupture with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\n\\nBefore the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun gained\\nany power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only half\\ndressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of\\nall the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast as\\na continual flow of tears would permit her. In this situation, Elinor,\\nroused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived her; and\\nafter observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a\\ntone of the most considerate gentleness,\\n\\n“Marianne, may I ask—?”\\n\\n“No, Elinor,” she replied, “ask nothing; you will soon know all.”\\n\\nThe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no\\nlonger than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return\\nof the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could\\ngo on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still\\nobliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of\\nher feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the\\nlast time to Willoughby.\\n\\nElinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and\\nshe would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not\\nMarianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous\\nirritability, not to speak to her for the world. In such circumstances,\\nit was better for both that they should not be long together; and the\\nrestless state of Marianne’s mind not only prevented her from remaining\\nin the room a moment after she was dressed, but requiring at once\\nsolitude and continual change of place, made her wander about the house\\ntill breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every body.\\n\\nAt breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and\\nElinor’s attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in\\npitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to\\nengage Mrs. Jennings’s notice entirely to herself.\\n\\nAs this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a\\nconsiderable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,\\nround the common working table, when a letter was delivered to\\nMarianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a\\ndeath-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as\\nplainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come\\nfrom Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her\\nhardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as\\nmade her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings’s notice. That good\\nlady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\\nWilloughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\\ntreated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to\\nher liking. Of Elinor’s distress, she was too busily employed in\\nmeasuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and\\ncalmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,\\n\\n“Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my\\nlife! _My_ girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish\\nenough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I\\nhope, from the bottom of my heart, he won’t keep her waiting much\\nlonger, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.\\nPray, when are they to be married?”\\n\\nElinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,\\nobliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,\\ntrying to smile, replied, “And have you really, Ma’am, talked yourself\\ninto a persuasion of my sister’s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I\\nthought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to\\nimply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive\\nyourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me\\nmore than to hear of their being going to be married.”\\n\\n“For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don’t we all\\nknow that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love\\nwith each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see them\\ntogether in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I know\\nthat your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding\\nclothes? Come, come, this won’t do. Because you are so sly about it\\nyourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such\\nthing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so\\nlong. I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.”\\n\\n“Indeed, Ma’am,” said Elinor, very seriously, “you are mistaken.\\nIndeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and\\nyou will find that you have though you will not believe me now.”\\n\\nMrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,\\nand eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried\\naway to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne\\nstretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,\\nand two or three others lying by her. Elinor drew near, but without\\nsaying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed\\nher affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of\\ntears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne’s. The\\nlatter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of\\nthis behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she\\nput all the letters into Elinor’s hands; and then covering her face\\nwith her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who knew\\nthat such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its\\ncourse, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent\\nitself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby’s letter, read as\\nfollows:\\n\\n                                    “Bond Street, January.\\n\\n\\n        MY DEAR MADAM,\\n    “I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for which I\\n    beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. I am much concerned to\\n    find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not\\n    meet your approbation; and though I am quite at a loss to discover\\n    in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat\\n    your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly\\n    unintentional. I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with\\n    your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and\\n    flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or\\n    misapprehension of my actions. My esteem for your whole family is\\n    very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to\\n    a belief of more than I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach\\n    myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that\\n    esteem. That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be\\n    impossible, when you understand that my affections have been long\\n    engaged elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before\\n    this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I obey\\n    your commands in returning the letters with which I have been\\n    honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly\\n    bestowed on me.\\n\\n\\n“I am, dear Madam,\\n“Your most obedient\\n“humble servant,\\n“JOHN WILLOUGHBY.”\\n\\n\\nWith what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss\\nDashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it\\nmust bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their\\nseparation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be\\nsuffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable\\nof departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and\\ndelicate feeling—so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to\\nsend a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing\\nwith his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no\\nbreach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever—a letter of\\nwhich every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be\\ndeep in hardened villainy.\\n\\nShe paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read\\nit again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her\\nabhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,\\nthat she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound\\nMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to\\nher of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most\\nirremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled\\nman, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.\\n\\nIn her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the\\ndepravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the\\nvery different mind of a very different person, who had no other\\nconnection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with\\nevery thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her\\nsister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so\\nentirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing\\na carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who\\ncould be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to\\nperceive Mrs. Jennings’s chariot, which she knew had not been ordered\\ntill one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of\\ncontributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse\\nherself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being\\nindisposed. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for\\nits cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing\\nher safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise\\nfrom the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from\\nfalling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest\\nand food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many\\nnights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longer\\nsupported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was\\nfelt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous\\nfaintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,\\nmade her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some\\nsense of her kindness, by saying,\\n\\n“Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!”\\n\\n“I only wish,” replied her sister, “there were any thing I _could_ do,\\nwhich might be of comfort to you.”\\n\\nThis, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,\\nwho could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, “Oh! Elinor, I am\\nmiserable, indeed,” before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.\\n\\nElinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in\\nsilence.\\n\\n“Exert yourself, dear Marianne,” she cried, “if you would not kill\\nyourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her\\nmisery while _you_ suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.”\\n\\n“I cannot, I cannot,” cried Marianne; “leave me, leave me, if I\\ndistress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so.\\nOh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of\\nexertion! Happy, happy Elinor, _you_ cannot have an idea of what I\\nsuffer.”\\n\\n“Do you call _me_ happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew!—And can you believe\\nme to be so, while I see you so wretched!”\\n\\n“Forgive me, forgive me,” throwing her arms round her sister’s neck; “I\\nknow you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are—you\\nmust be happy; Edward loves you—what, oh what, can do away such\\nhappiness as that?”\\n\\n“Many, many circumstances,” said Elinor, solemnly.\\n\\n“No, no, no,” cried Marianne wildly, “he loves you, and only you. You\\n_can_ have no grief.”\\n\\n“I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.”\\n\\n“And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing\\ncan do away.”\\n\\n“You must not talk so, Marianne. Have you no comforts? no friends? Is\\nyour loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you suffer\\nnow, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his\\ncharacter had been delayed to a later period—if your engagement had\\nbeen carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he\\nchose to put an end to it. Every additional day of unhappy confidence,\\non your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.”\\n\\n“Engagement!” cried Marianne, “there has been no engagement.”\\n\\n“No engagement!”\\n\\n“No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith\\nwith me.”\\n\\n“But he told you that he loved you.”\\n\\n“Yes—no—never absolutely. It was every day implied, but never\\nprofessedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been, but it never\\nwas.”\\n\\n“Yet you wrote to him?”\\n\\n“Yes: could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot\\ntalk.”\\n\\nElinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now\\nraised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the\\ncontents of all. The first, which was what her sister had sent him on\\ntheir arrival in town, was to this effect.\\n\\nBerkeley Street, January.\\n\\n\\n“How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this; and I think\\nyou will feel something more than surprise, when you know that I am in\\ntown. An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs. Jennings, was a\\ntemptation we could not resist. I wish you may receive this in time to\\ncome here to-night, but I will not depend on it. At any rate I shall\\nexpect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.\\n\\n\\n“M.D.”\\n\\n\\nHer second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance\\nat the Middletons’, was in these words:—\\n\\n“I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the day before\\nyesterday, nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a\\nnote which I sent you above a week ago. I have been expecting to hear\\nfrom you, and still more to see you, every hour of the day. Pray call\\nagain as soon as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected\\nthis in vain. You had better come earlier another time, because we are\\ngenerally out by one. We were last night at Lady Middleton’s, where\\nthere was a dance. I have been told that you were asked to be of the\\nparty. But could it be so? You must be very much altered indeed since\\nwe parted, if that could be the case, and you not there. But I will not\\nsuppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your personal\\nassurance of its being otherwise.\\n\\n\\n“M.D.”\\n\\n\\nThe contents of her last note to him were these:—\\n\\n“What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last night? Again\\nI demand an explanation of it. I was prepared to meet you with the\\npleasure which our separation naturally produced, with the familiarity\\nwhich our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed\\nindeed! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a\\nconduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though I\\nhave not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your\\nbehaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it. You\\nhave perhaps been misinformed, or purposely deceived, in something\\nconcerning me, which may have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me what\\nit is, explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be\\nsatisfied, in being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to\\nbe obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn\\nthat you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that your regard\\nfor us all was insincere, that your behaviour to me was intended only\\nto deceive, let it be told as soon as possible. My feelings are at\\npresent in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but\\ncertainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. If your\\nsentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my notes, and\\nthe lock of my hair which is in your possession.\\n\\n\\n“M.D.”\\n\\n\\nThat such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been\\nso answered, Elinor, for Willoughby’s sake, would have been unwilling\\nto believe. But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the\\nimpropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silently\\ngrieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs\\nof tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely\\ncondemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished\\nthe letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any\\none would have written in the same situation.\\n\\n“I felt myself,” she added, “to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if\\nthe strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.”\\n\\n“I can believe it,” said Elinor; “but unfortunately he did not feel the\\nsame.”\\n\\n“He _did_ feel the same, Elinor—for weeks and weeks he felt it. I know\\nhe did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the\\nblackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear\\nto him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can\\nso readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest\\nsupplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his\\nvoice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being\\ntogether at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When he told me\\nthat it might be many weeks before we met again—his distress—can I ever\\nforget his distress?”\\n\\nFor a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had\\npassed away, she added, in a firmer tone,\\n\\n“Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.”\\n\\n“Dearest Marianne, who but himself? By whom can he have been\\ninstigated?”\\n\\n“By all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather believe\\nevery creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his\\nopinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This woman of\\nwhom he writes—whoever she be—or any one, in short, but your own dear\\nself, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me. Beyond\\nyou three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather\\nsuspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?”\\n\\nElinor would not contend, and only replied, “Whoever may have been so\\ndetestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,\\nmy dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a reasonable\\nand laudable pride which resists such malevolence.”\\n\\n“No, no,” cried Marianne, “misery such as mine has no pride. I care not\\nwho knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be open\\nto all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud\\nand independent as they like—may resist insult, or return\\nmortification—but I cannot. I must feel—I must be wretched—and they are\\nwelcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.”\\n\\n“But for my mother’s sake and mine—”\\n\\n“I would do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so\\nmiserable—Oh! who can require it?”\\n\\nAgain they were both silent. Elinor was employed in walking\\nthoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,\\nwithout knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning\\nobjects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,\\nwith her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up\\nWilloughby’s letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,\\nexclaimed,—\\n\\n“It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!\\nCruel, cruel—nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he\\nmight have heard against me—ought he not to have suspended his belief?\\nought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power of\\nclearing myself? ‘The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)\\nwhich you so obligingly bestowed on me’—That is unpardonable.\\nWilloughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh,\\nbarbarously insolent!—Elinor, can he be justified?”\\n\\n“No, Marianne, in no possible way.”\\n\\n“And yet this woman—who knows what her art may have been?—how long it\\nmay have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!—Who is\\nshe?—Who can she be?—Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and\\nattractive among his female acquaintance?—Oh! no one, no one—he talked\\nto me only of myself.”\\n\\nAnother pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.\\n\\n“Elinor, I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be gone\\nto-morrow?”\\n\\n“To-morrow, Marianne!”\\n\\n“Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby’s sake—and now\\nwho cares for me? Who regards me?”\\n\\n“It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more\\nthan civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a\\nhasty removal as that.”\\n\\n“Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I\\ncannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.\\nThe Middletons and Palmers—how am I to bear their pity? The pity of\\nsuch a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would _he_ say to that!”\\n\\nElinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but\\nno attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body\\nshe moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more\\nhysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at\\nall, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for\\nassistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length\\npersuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings\\nreturned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and without\\nwaiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door and\\nwalked in with a look of real concern.\\n\\n“How do you do my dear?”—said she in a voice of great compassion to\\nMarianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.\\n\\n“How is she, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she looks very bad. No wonder.\\nAy, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon—a\\ngood-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told\\nme of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend\\nof Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it; and\\nI was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say is,\\nthat if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance\\nabominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his\\nheart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I\\nhave no notion of men’s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him\\nagain, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a\\nday. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the\\nonly young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you\\nwill never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won’t disturb her any\\nlonger, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with.\\nThe Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that\\nwill amuse her.”\\n\\nShe then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she\\nsupposed her young friend’s affliction could be increased by noise.\\n\\nMarianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with\\nthem. Elinor even advised her against it. But “no, she would go down;\\nshe could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.”\\nElinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,\\nthough believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,\\nsaid no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,\\nwhile Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into\\nthe dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.\\n\\nWhen there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer\\nthan her sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had she been\\nconscious of half Mrs. Jennings’s well-meant but ill-judged attentions\\nto her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a\\nsyllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts\\npreserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.\\n\\nElinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings’s kindness, though its\\neffusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made\\nher those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her\\nsister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend saw that\\nMarianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her which\\nmight make her at all less so. She treated her therefore, with all the\\nindulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last\\nday of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,\\nwas to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to be\\namused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in\\nthe sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could\\nhave been entertained by Mrs. Jennings’s endeavours to cure a\\ndisappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a\\ngood fire. As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was\\nforced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.\\nWith a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to\\nfollow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.\\n\\n“Poor soul!” cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, “how it\\ngrieves me to see her! And I declare if she is not gone away without\\nfinishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to\\ndo her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I\\nwould send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to\\nme, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is\\nplenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless\\nyou! they care no more about such things!—”\\n\\n“The lady then—Miss Grey I think you called her—is very rich?”\\n\\n“Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart, stylish\\ngirl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt very well, Biddy\\nHenshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family are all rich\\ntogether. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won’t come\\nbefore it’s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. No wonder!\\ndashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don’t signify\\ntalking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to\\na pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off\\nfrom his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to\\nhave him. Why don’t he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house,\\nturn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant\\nyou, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came\\nround. But that won’t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can\\never be given up by the young men of this age.”\\n\\n“Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be\\namiable?”\\n\\n“I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her\\nmentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day\\nMiss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would\\nnot be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could\\nnever agree.”\\n\\n“And who are the Ellisons?”\\n\\n“Her guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for\\nherself; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now,” after pausing a\\nmoment—“your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by\\nherself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? Poor dear, it\\nseems quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by-and-by we shall have a\\nfew friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at?\\nShe hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?”\\n\\n“Dear ma’am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,\\nwill not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I\\ncan to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.”\\n\\n“Aye, I believe that will be best for her. Let her name her own supper,\\nand go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast\\ndown this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging\\nover her head as long as that. And so the letter that came today\\nfinished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I would\\nnot have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know, how\\nshould I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but a\\ncommon love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at\\nabout them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when\\nthey hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in\\nConduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see\\nthem tomorrow.”\\n\\n“It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and\\nSir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest\\nallusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature\\nmust point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to\\nmyself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my\\ndear madam will easily believe.”\\n\\n“Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear\\nit talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a\\nword about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.\\nNo more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very\\nthoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I\\ncertainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such\\nthings, the better, the sooner ’tis blown over and forgot. And what\\ngood does talking ever do you know?”\\n\\n“In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases\\nof a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for\\nthe sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the\\npublic conversation. I must do _this_ justice to Mr. Willoughby—he has\\nbroken no positive engagement with my sister.”\\n\\n“Law, my dear! Don’t pretend to defend him. No positive engagement\\nindeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the\\nvery rooms they were to live in hereafter!”\\n\\nElinor, for her sister’s sake, could not press the subject farther, and\\nshe hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby’s; since, though\\nMarianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement\\nof the real truth. After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,\\nwith all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\\n\\n“Well, my dear, ’tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be\\nall the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye, that\\nhe will. Mind me, now, if they an’t married by Mid-summer. Lord! how\\nhe’ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will be\\nall to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year without\\ndebt or drawback—except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had\\nforgot her; but she may be ’prenticed out at a small cost, and then\\nwhat does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly\\nwhat I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and\\nconveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered\\nwith the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in\\none corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were\\nthere! Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a\\nvery pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;\\nand, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\\nfrom the turnpike-road, so ’tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\\nup in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages\\nthat pass along. Oh! ’tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the\\nvillage, and the parsonage-house within a stone’s throw. To my fancy, a\\nthousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send\\nthree miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your\\nmother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. One\\nshoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we _can_ but put\\nWilloughby out of her head!”\\n\\n“Ay, if we can do _that_, Ma’am,” said Elinor, “we shall do very well\\nwith or without Colonel Brandon.” And then rising, she went away to\\njoin Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,\\nleaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,\\ntill Elinor’s entrance, had been her only light.\\n\\n“You had better leave me,” was all the notice that her sister received\\nfrom her.\\n\\n“I will leave you,” said Elinor, “if you will go to bed.” But this,\\nfrom the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first\\nrefused to do. Her sister’s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,\\nsoon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her aching head\\non the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet rest before\\nshe left her.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\\nMrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.\\n\\n“My dear,” said she, entering, “I have just recollected that I have\\nsome of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was\\ntasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor\\nhusband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old\\ncolicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the\\nworld. Do take it to your sister.”\\n\\n“Dear Ma’am,” replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the\\ncomplaints for which it was recommended, “how good you are! But I have\\njust left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\\nnothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\\nleave, I will drink the wine myself.”\\n\\nMrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\\nearlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she\\nswallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a\\ncolicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing\\npowers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself\\nas on her sister.\\n\\nColonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner\\nof looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that\\nhe neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\\nwas already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs. Jennings was not\\nstruck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked\\nacross the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered,\\n“The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. He knows nothing of it; do\\ntell him, my dear.”\\n\\nHe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look\\nwhich perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her\\nsister.\\n\\n“Marianne is not well,” said she. “She has been indisposed all day, and\\nwe have persuaded her to go to bed.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, then,” he hesitatingly replied, “what I heard this morning\\nmay be—there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“What did you hear?”\\n\\n“That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think—in short, that a man,\\nwhom I _knew_ to be engaged—but how shall I tell you? If you know it\\nalready, as surely you must, I may be spared.”\\n\\n“You mean,” answered Elinor, with forced calmness, “Mr. Willoughby’s\\nmarriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we _do_ know it all. This seems to have\\nbeen a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded\\nit to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?”\\n\\n“In a stationer’s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies\\nwere waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other\\nan account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting\\nconcealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name of\\nWilloughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my\\nattention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing\\nwas now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey—it was\\nno longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks,\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,\\nespecially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still\\nmore:—as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna,\\nhis seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!—but it would be impossible\\nto describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry,\\nfor I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and\\nthat, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey’s\\nguardian.”\\n\\n“It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand\\npounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.”\\n\\n“It may be so; but Willoughby is capable—at least I think”—he stopped a\\nmoment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, “And\\nyour sister—how did she—”\\n\\n“Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they\\nmay be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel\\naffliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;\\nand even now, perhaps—but _I_ am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some\\npoints, there seems a hardness of heart about him.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said Colonel Brandon, “there is, indeed! But your sister does\\nnot—I think you said so—she does not consider quite as you do?”\\n\\n“You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still\\njustify him if she could.”\\n\\nHe made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the\\ntea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was\\nnecessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure\\nwhile they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss\\nDashwood’s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel\\nBrandon’s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of\\nhope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening\\nmore serious and thoughtful than usual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\n\\nFrom a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the\\nnext morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had\\nclosed her eyes.\\n\\nElinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and\\nbefore breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and\\nagain; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on\\nElinor’s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\\nMarianne’s, as before. Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as\\nunfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every\\nconsolation in the impossibility of acquitting him. At one moment she\\nwas absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at\\nanother she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\\ncould resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she was uniform,\\nwhen it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the\\npresence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to\\nendure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings’s\\nentering into her sorrows with any compassion.\\n\\n“No, no, no, it cannot be,” she cried; “she cannot feel. Her kindness\\nis not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants\\nis gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.”\\n\\nElinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her\\nsister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable\\nrefinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her\\non the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished\\nmanner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be\\nthat are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an\\nexcellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She expected\\nfrom other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she\\njudged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on\\nherself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together\\nin their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.\\nJennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own\\nweakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though\\nMrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.\\n\\nWith a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,\\nfrom the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room,\\nsaying,\\n\\n“Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.”\\n\\nMarianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her\\na letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,\\nexplanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and\\ninstantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room\\nto inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances\\nof his letter. The work of one moment was destroyed by the next. The\\nhand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her;\\nand, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an\\necstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had\\nnever suffered.\\n\\nThe cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in her\\nmoments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could\\nreproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violence—a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its\\nobject, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still\\nreferring her to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she was\\ncalm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled every\\npage. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as\\nwarmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor’s\\napplication, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them\\nboth; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for\\nWilloughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each\\nother, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.\\n\\nAll her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was\\ndearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken\\nconfidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone. Elinor,\\nunable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be\\nin London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of\\npatience till their mother’s wishes could be known; and at length she\\nobtained her sister’s consent to wait for that knowledge.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy\\ntill the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;\\nand positively refusing Elinor’s offered attendance, went out alone for\\nthe rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the\\npain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne’s\\nletter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then\\nsat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat\\nher directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the\\ndrawing-room on Mrs. Jennings’s going away, remained fixed at the table\\nwhere Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over\\nher for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly\\nover its effect on her mother.\\n\\nIn this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when\\nMarianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was\\nstartled by a rap at the door.\\n\\n“Who can this be?” cried Elinor. “So early too! I thought we _had_ been\\nsafe.”\\n\\nMarianne moved to the window.\\n\\n“It is Colonel Brandon!” said she, with vexation. “We are never safe\\nfrom _him_.”\\n\\n“He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.”\\n\\n“I will not trust to _that_,” retreating to her own room. “A man who\\nhas nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion\\non that of others.”\\n\\nThe event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on\\ninjustice and error; for Colonel Brandon _did_ come in; and Elinor, who\\nwas convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who\\nsaw _that_ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his\\nanxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister\\nfor esteeming him so lightly.\\n\\n“I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,” said he, after the first\\nsalutation, “and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more\\neasily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you\\nalone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object—my wish—my sole\\nwish in desiring it—I hope, I believe it is—is to be a means of giving\\ncomfort;—no, I must not say comfort—not present comfort—but conviction,\\nlasting conviction to your sister’s mind. My regard for her, for\\nyourself, for your mother—will you allow me to prove it, by relating\\nsome circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere regard—nothing\\nbut an earnest desire of being useful—I think I am justified—though\\nwhere so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am\\nright, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?” He stopped.\\n\\n“I understand you,” said Elinor. “You have something to tell me of Mr.\\nWilloughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will\\nbe the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. _My_\\ngratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to\\nthat end, and _hers_ must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me\\nhear it.”\\n\\n“You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,—but\\nthis will give you no idea—I must go farther back. You will find me a\\nvery awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A\\nshort account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it _shall_\\nbe a short one. On such a subject,” sighing heavily, “can I have little\\ntemptation to be diffuse.”\\n\\nHe stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went\\non.\\n\\n“You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation—(it is not to be\\nsupposed that it could make any impression on you)—a conversation\\nbetween us one evening at Barton Park—it was the evening of a dance—in\\nwhich I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some\\nmeasure, your sister Marianne.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” answered Elinor, “I have _not_ forgotten it.” He looked\\npleased by this remembrance, and added,\\n\\n“If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender\\nrecollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well\\nin mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of\\nfancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan\\nfrom her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages\\nwere nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows\\nand friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and\\nmy affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from\\nmy present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable\\nof having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the\\nattachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a\\ndifferent cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me\\nfor ever. She was married—married against her inclination to my\\nbrother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.\\nAnd this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who\\nwas at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he\\ndid not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support\\nher under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the\\nmisery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame\\nall her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing—but how\\nblindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We\\nwere within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The\\ntreachery, or the folly, of my cousin’s maid betrayed us. I was\\nbanished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no\\nliberty, no society, no amusement, till my father’s point was gained. I\\nhad depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe\\none—but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few\\nmonths must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now\\nto lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard\\nfor her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from\\nthe first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind\\nso young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon’s, was but too\\nnatural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her\\nsituation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that,\\nwith such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to\\nadvise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after\\ntheir marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she\\nshould fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps—but I meant to promote\\nthe happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that\\npurpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had\\ngiven me,” he continued, in a voice of great agitation, “was of\\ntrifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two\\nyears afterwards, of her divorce. It was _that_ which threw this\\ngloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered—”\\n\\nHe could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about\\nthe room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his\\ndistress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her, took\\nher hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few\\nminutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.\\n\\n“It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned\\nto England. My first care, when I _did_ arrive, was of course to seek\\nfor her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could\\nnot trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\\nfear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\\nsin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\\nsufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\\nbrother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\\nthat her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\\ndispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I\\nhad been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former\\nservant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to\\nvisit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and\\nthere, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my\\nunfortunate sister. So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of\\nevery kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure\\nbefore me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,\\non whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her—but I have\\nno right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have\\npained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in the\\nlast stage of a consumption, was—yes, in such a situation it was my\\ngreatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for\\na better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her placed in\\ncomfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every\\nday during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last\\nmoments.”\\n\\nAgain he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in\\nan exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate\\nfriend.\\n\\n“Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,” said he, “by the resemblance\\nI have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates,\\ntheir fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet\\ndisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier\\nmarriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other\\nbe. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you\\nfor nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood—a subject such as this—untouched for\\nfourteen years—it is dangerous to handle it at all! I _will_ be more\\ncollected—more concise. She left to my care her only child, a little\\ngirl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about\\nthree years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.\\nIt was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have\\ndischarged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education\\nmyself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no\\nfamily, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I\\nsaw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother,\\n(which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the\\npossession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I\\ncalled her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in\\ngeneral been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now\\nthree years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I\\nremoved her from school, to place her under the care of a very\\nrespectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four\\nor five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I\\nhad every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February,\\nalmost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her,\\n(imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go\\nto Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father\\nthere for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I\\nthought well of his daughter—better than she deserved, for, with a most\\nobstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no\\nclue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning,\\nbut not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no\\ninformation; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the\\ngirls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they\\nchose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced\\nhimself, of his daughter’s being entirely unconcerned in the business.\\nIn short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest,\\nfor eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I\\nfeared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.”\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried Elinor, “could it be—could Willoughby!”—\\n\\n“The first news that reached me of her,” he continued, “came in a\\nletter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from\\nDelaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party\\nto Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\\nwhich I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,\\nand which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby\\nimagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\\nbreaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom\\nhe had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would it\\nhave availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles\\nof your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who _can_\\nfeel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and\\ninnocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with\\nno creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He\\nhad left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\\nrelieved her.”\\n\\n“This is beyond every thing!” exclaimed Elinor.\\n\\n“His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than\\nboth. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I\\nmust have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on\\nbeing assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\\nfor all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you alone, I\\ncame determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it\\n_was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now\\nyou will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see\\nyour sister—but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with\\nsuccess; and sometimes I thought your sister’s influence might yet\\nreclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\\nwere his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may\\nnow, and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her own\\ncondition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she\\nconsiders the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and\\npictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as\\nstrong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which\\nmust attend her through life. Surely this comparison must have its use\\nwith her. She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed\\nfrom no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every\\nfriend must be made still more her friend by them. Concern for her\\nunhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen\\nevery attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to\\nher what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect;\\nbut had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of\\nservice, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to\\ntrouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital\\nwhich may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of\\nothers.”\\n\\nElinor’s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;\\nattended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to\\nMarianne, from the communication of what had passed.\\n\\n“I have been more pained,” said she, “by her endeavors to acquit him\\nthan by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most\\nperfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first she\\nwill suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have you,” she\\ncontinued, after a short silence, “ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you\\nleft him at Barton?”\\n\\n“Yes,” he replied gravely, “once I have. One meeting was unavoidable.”\\n\\nElinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying,\\n\\n“What? have you met him to—”\\n\\n“I could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most\\nreluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which\\nwas within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to\\ndefend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the\\nmeeting, therefore, never got abroad.”\\n\\nElinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a\\nsoldier she presumed not to censure it.\\n\\n“Such,” said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, “has been the unhappy\\nresemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly\\nhave I discharged my trust!”\\n\\n“Is she still in town?”\\n\\n“No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near\\nher delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there\\nshe remains.”\\n\\nRecollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor\\nfrom her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again\\nthe same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion\\nand esteem for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\n\\nWhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss\\nDashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was\\nnot entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne\\nappeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to\\nit all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither\\nobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and\\nseemed to show by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But\\nthough this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt\\n_was_ carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the\\neffect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,\\nin her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of\\ncompassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently\\nirritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind did\\nbecome settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the\\nloss of Willoughby’s character yet more heavily than she had felt the\\nloss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the\\nmisery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might\\n_once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits,\\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to\\nElinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to\\nher sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most\\nfrequent confession of them.\\n\\nTo give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and\\nanswering Elinor’s letter would be only to give a repetition of what\\nher daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly\\nless painful than Marianne’s, and an indignation even greater than\\nElinor’s. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other, arrived\\nto tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her anxious\\nsolicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with fortitude\\nunder this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne’s\\naffliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying and\\nhumiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which _she_ could wish\\nher not to indulge!\\n\\nAgainst the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had\\ndetermined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at\\nthat time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be\\nbringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by\\nconstantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen\\nhim there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means\\nnot to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,\\nthough never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at\\nleast five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of\\ncompany, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable\\nthere, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some\\ninterest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the\\nideas of both might now be spurned by her.\\n\\nFrom all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her\\nto be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his\\nacquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her\\nfriends. Design could never bring them in each other’s way: negligence\\ncould never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in\\nits favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of\\nBarton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at\\nAllenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first\\nas a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.\\n\\nShe had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where\\nthey were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his\\nwife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged\\nit right that they should sometimes see their brother.\\n\\nMarianne had promised to be guided by her mother’s opinion, and she\\nsubmitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved\\nperfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt\\nit to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by\\nrequiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her\\nmother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent\\nher ever knowing a moment’s rest.\\n\\nBut it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil\\nto herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other\\nhand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward\\nentirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay\\nwould therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better\\nfor Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.\\n\\nHer carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby’s\\nname mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing\\nit herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor\\nSir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.\\nElinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards\\nherself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day\\nafter day to the indignation of them all.\\n\\nSir John, could not have thought it possible. “A man of whom he had\\nalways had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He\\ndid not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an\\nunaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart.\\nHe would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for\\nall the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,\\nand they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel of\\na fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that\\nhe had offered him one of Folly’s puppies! and this was the end of it!”\\n\\nMrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. “She was determined to drop\\nhis acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she had\\nnever been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her heart\\nCombe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify, for it\\nwas a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she\\nwas resolved never to mention his name again, and she should tell\\neverybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.”\\n\\nThe rest of Mrs. Palmer’s sympathy was shown in procuring all the\\nparticulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating\\nthem to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker’s the new\\ncarriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby’s portrait was\\ndrawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey’s clothes might be seen.\\n\\nThe calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a\\nhappy relief to Elinor’s spirits, oppressed as they often were by the\\nclamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to be\\nsure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their\\ncircle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who\\nwould meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any\\nanxiety for her sister’s health.\\n\\nEvery qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the\\nmoment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down\\nby officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to\\ncomfort than good-nature.\\n\\nLady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,\\nor twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, “It is very\\nshocking, indeed!” and by the means of this continual though gentle\\nvent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first\\nwithout the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without\\nrecollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the\\ndignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was\\nwrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the\\ninterest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather\\nagainst the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once\\nbe a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon\\nas she married.\\n\\nColonel Brandon’s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome\\nto Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate\\ndiscussion of her sister’s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with\\nconfidence. His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing\\npast sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye\\nwith which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her\\nvoice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or\\ncould oblige herself to speak to him. _These_ assured him that his\\nexertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and\\n_these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but\\nMrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the\\nColonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail\\non him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for\\nhim, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of\\nMidsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of\\na week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding\\nbetween the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the\\nhonours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all\\nbe made over to _her;_ and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to\\nthink at all of Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\nEarly in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby’s\\nletter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he\\nwas married. She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to\\nherself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was\\ndesirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from\\nthe public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.\\n\\nShe received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on\\nit, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst\\nout, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less\\npitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.\\n\\nThe Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now\\nhoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to\\nprevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow\\nfirst fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.\\n\\nAbout this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin’s\\nhouse in Bartlett’s Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again\\nbefore their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and\\nwere welcomed by them all with great cordiality.\\n\\nElinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her pain,\\nand she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the\\noverpowering delight of Lucy in finding her _still_ in town.\\n\\n“I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here\\n_still_,” said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word. “But\\nI always thought I _should_. I was almost sure you would not leave\\nLondon yet awhile; though you _told_ me, you know, at Barton, that you\\nshould not stay above a _month_. But I thought, at the time, that you\\nwould most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would\\nhave been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and\\nsister came. And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone. I\\nam amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word_.”\\n\\nElinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her\\nself-command to make it appear that she did _not_.\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Jennings, “and how did you travel?”\\n\\n“Not in the stage, I assure you,” replied Miss Steele, with quick\\nexultation; “we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to\\nattend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we’d join\\nhim in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or\\ntwelve shillings more than we did.”\\n\\n“Oh, oh!” cried Mrs. Jennings; “very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is\\na single man, I warrant you.”\\n\\n“There now,” said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, “everybody laughs\\nat me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they\\nare sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never\\nthink about him from one hour’s end to another. ‘Lord! here comes your\\nbeau, Nancy,’ my cousin said t’other day, when she saw him crossing the\\nstreet to the house. My beau, indeed! said I—I cannot think who you\\nmean. The Doctor is no beau of mine.”\\n\\n“Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking—but it won’t do—the Doctor is\\nthe man, I see.”\\n\\n“No, indeed!” replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, “and I beg\\nyou will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.”\\n\\nMrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she\\ncertainly would _not_, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.\\n\\n“I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss\\nDashwood, when they come to town,” said Lucy, returning, after a\\ncessation of hostile hints, to the charge.\\n\\n“No, I do not think we shall.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I dare say you will.”\\n\\nElinor would not humour her by farther opposition.\\n\\n“What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for\\nso long a time together!”\\n\\n“Long a time, indeed!” interposed Mrs. Jennings. “Why, their visit is\\nbut just begun!”\\n\\nLucy was silenced.\\n\\n“I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,” said Miss\\nSteele. “I am sorry she is not well—” for Marianne had left the room on\\ntheir arrival.\\n\\n“You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the\\npleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with\\nnervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.”\\n\\n“Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I\\nthink she might see _us;_ and I am sure we would not speak a word.”\\n\\nElinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was\\nperhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore\\nnot able to come to them.\\n\\n“Oh, if that’s all,” cried Miss Steele, “we can just as well go and see\\n_her_.”\\n\\nElinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she\\nwas saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy’s sharp reprimand, which\\nnow, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the\\nmanners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the\\nother.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\n\\nAfter some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister’s entreaties, and\\nconsented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an\\nhour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and\\nwould do no more than accompany them to Gray’s in Sackville Street,\\nwhere Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few\\nold-fashioned jewels of her mother.\\n\\nWhen they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was\\na lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as\\nshe had no business at Gray’s, it was resolved, that while her young\\nfriends transacted their’s, she should pay her visit and return for\\nthem.\\n\\nOn ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before\\nthem in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to\\ntheir orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be done\\nwas, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\\nquickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is\\nprobable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to\\na quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy of\\nhis taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He was giving orders for\\na toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments\\nwere determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a\\nquarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally\\narranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to bestow any\\nother attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or\\nfour very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on\\nElinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural,\\nsterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.\\n\\nMarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and\\nresentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on\\nthe puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of\\nthe different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining\\nunconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts\\nwithin herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in\\nMr. Gray’s shop, as in her own bedroom.\\n\\nAt last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,\\nall received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last\\nday on which his existence could be continued without the possession of\\nthe toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and\\nbestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as\\nseemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a\\nhappy air of real conceit and affected indifference.\\n\\nElinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point\\nof concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.\\nShe turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise\\nto be her brother.\\n\\nTheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very\\ncreditable appearance in Mr. Gray’s shop. John Dashwood was really far\\nfrom being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them\\nsatisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and\\nattentive.\\n\\nElinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.\\n\\n“I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,” said he, “but it was\\nimpossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at\\nExeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.\\nHarry was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended to call\\non you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always\\nso much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny\\na seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in\\nBerkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I\\nunderstand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too,\\nyou must introduce me to _them_. As my mother-in-law’s relations, I\\nshall be happy to show them every respect. They are excellent\\nneighbours to you in the country, I understand.”\\n\\n“Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness\\nin every particular, is more than I can express.”\\n\\n“I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.\\nBut so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are\\nrelated to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to\\nmake your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you\\nare most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for\\nnothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the\\nmost complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all\\nseemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us\\nto hear it, I assure you.”\\n\\nElinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to\\nbe spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.\\nJennings’s servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for\\nthem at the door.\\n\\nMr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings\\nat the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to\\ncall on them the next day, took leave.\\n\\nHis visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from\\ntheir sister-in-law, for not coming too; “but she was so much engaged\\nwith her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.”\\nMrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand\\nupon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she\\nshould certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her\\nsisters to see her. His manners to _them_, though calm, were perfectly\\nkind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel\\nBrandon’s coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity\\nwhich seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be\\nequally civil to _him_.\\n\\nAfter staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him\\nto Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.\\nThe weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. As soon as\\nthey were out of the house, his enquiries began.\\n\\n“Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?”\\n\\n“Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.”\\n\\n“I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,\\nElinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable\\nestablishment in life.”\\n\\n“Me, brother! what do you mean?”\\n\\n“He likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What is\\nthe amount of his fortune?”\\n\\n“I believe about two thousand a year.”\\n\\n“Two thousand a-year;” and then working himself up to a pitch of\\nenthusiastic generosity, he added, “Elinor, I wish with all my heart it\\nwere _twice_ as much, for your sake.”\\n\\n“Indeed I believe you,” replied Elinor; “but I am very sure that\\nColonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me_.”\\n\\n“You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little\\ntrouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be\\nundecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his\\nfriends may all advise him against it. But some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\\nhim, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should not\\ntry for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your\\nside—in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite\\nout of the question, the objections are insurmountable—you have too\\nmuch sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no\\ncivility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and\\nyour family. It is a match that must give universal satisfaction. In\\nshort, it is a kind of thing that”—lowering his voice to an important\\nwhisper—“will be exceedingly welcome to _all parties_.” Recollecting\\nhimself, however, he added, “That is, I mean to say—your friends are\\nall truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she\\nhas your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her mother too,\\nMrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her\\ngreat pleasure; she said as much the other day.”\\n\\nElinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\\n\\n“It would be something remarkable, now,” he continued, “something\\ndroll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the\\nsame time. And yet it is not very unlikely.”\\n\\n“Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,” said Elinor, with resolution, “going to be\\nmarried?”\\n\\n“It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation. He\\nhas a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality,\\nwill come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match\\ntakes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter of the\\nlate Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable\\nconnection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in\\ntime. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to\\nmake over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give you\\nanother instance of her liberality:—The other day, as soon as we came\\nto town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,\\nshe put bank-notes into Fanny’s hands to the amount of two hundred\\npounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\\nexpense while we are here.”\\n\\nHe paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,\\n\\n“Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;\\nbut your income is a large one.”\\n\\n“Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to\\ncomplain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will\\nin time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is\\na most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase within\\nthis half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where\\nold Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me in every\\nrespect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my\\nduty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it\\nfall into any other hands. A man must pay for his convenience; and it\\n_has_ cost me a vast deal of money.”\\n\\n“More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.”\\n\\n“Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for\\nmore than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\\nbeen very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\\nthat if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker’s\\nhands, I must have sold out to very great loss.”\\n\\nElinor could only smile.\\n\\n“Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to\\nNorland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the\\nStanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\\nto your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an\\nundoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in\\nconsequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of\\nlinen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away. You may\\nguess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being\\nrich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars’s kindness is.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Elinor; “and assisted by her liberality, I hope you\\nmay yet live to be in easy circumstances.”\\n\\n“Another year or two may do much towards it,” he gravely replied; “but\\nhowever there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone\\nlaid of Fanny’s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the\\nflower-garden marked out.”\\n\\n“Where is the green-house to be?”\\n\\n“Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come\\ndown to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many parts\\nof the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and\\nbe exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns that\\ngrew in patches over the brow.”\\n\\nElinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very\\nthankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.\\n\\nHaving now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the\\nnecessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his\\nnext visit at Gray’s, his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he\\nbegan to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\\n\\n“She seems a most valuable woman indeed. Her house, her style of\\nliving, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance\\nthat has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may\\nprove materially advantageous. Her inviting you to town is certainly a\\nvast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a\\nregard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be\\nforgotten. She must have a great deal to leave.”\\n\\n“Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her\\njointure, which will descend to her children.”\\n\\n“But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few\\npeople of common prudence will do _that_ and whatever she saves, she\\nwill be able to dispose of.”\\n\\n“And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her\\ndaughters, than to us?”\\n\\n“Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I\\ncannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther. Whereas,\\nin my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and treating you in\\nthis kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her future\\nconsideration, which a conscientious woman would not disregard. Nothing\\ncan be kinder than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this,\\nwithout being aware of the expectation it raises.”\\n\\n“But she raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your\\nanxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.”\\n\\n“Why, to be sure,” said he, seeming to recollect himself, “people have\\nlittle, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is\\nthe matter with Marianne?—she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,\\nand is grown quite thin. Is she ill?”\\n\\n“She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several\\nweeks.”\\n\\n“I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness\\ndestroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She was as\\nhandsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract\\nthe man. There was something in her style of beauty, to please them\\nparticularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner\\nand better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _you_,\\nbut so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken, however. I\\nquestion whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth more than five\\nor six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if\\n_you_ do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire;\\nbut, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;\\nand I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the\\nearliest and best pleased of your visitors.”\\n\\nElinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no\\nlikelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation\\nof too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really\\nresolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the\\nmarriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough\\nfor having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly\\nanxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from\\nColonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect.\\n\\nThey were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John\\ncame in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on all\\nsides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did\\nnot seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very\\ngood-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his\\nappearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood\\nwent away delighted with both.\\n\\n“I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,” said he, as he\\nwalked back with his sister. “Lady Middleton is really a most elegant\\nwoman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.\\nJennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant\\nas her daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting\\n_her_, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very\\nnaturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man\\nwho had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were\\nboth strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters were\\nsuch kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But now I can\\ncarry her a most satisfactory account of both.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\n\\nMrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband’s judgment,\\nthat she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her\\ndaughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy\\nher notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most\\ncharming women in the world!\\n\\nLady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a kind\\nof cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted\\nthem; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of\\ndemeanor, and a general want of understanding.\\n\\nThe same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the\\ngood opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,\\nand to _her_ she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking\\nwoman of uncordial address, who met her husband’s sisters without any\\naffection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of\\nthe quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least\\nseven minutes and a half in silence.\\n\\nElinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask,\\nwhether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny\\nvoluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that\\nhis marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband’s\\nexpectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed\\nthem still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be\\ntoo sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The\\nintelligence however, which _she_ would not give, soon flowed from\\nanother quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor’s compassion on\\nbeing unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and\\nMrs. Dashwood. He dared not come to Bartlett’s Buildings for fear of\\ndetection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be\\ntold, they could do nothing at present but write.\\n\\nEdward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short\\ntime, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on\\nthe table, when they returned from their morning’s engagements. Elinor\\nwas pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,\\nthough not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to\\ngive them—a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited\\nthem to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house\\nfor three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited\\nlikewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,\\nalways glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager\\ncivilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. They were to\\nmeet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to\\nbe of the party. The expectation of seeing _her_, however, was enough\\nto make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet\\nEdward’s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to\\nattend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect\\nindifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in\\ncompany with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was\\nas lively as ever.\\n\\nThe interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon\\nafterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing\\nthat the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.\\n\\nSo well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable\\nhad their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly\\nnot so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as\\nSir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it\\nhappened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as\\nthe Dashwoods’ invitation was known, that their visit should begin a\\nfew days before the party took place.\\n\\nTheir claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the\\ngentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not\\nhave done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but\\nas Lady Middleton’s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long\\nwanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of\\ntheir characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity\\nof endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,\\nthan she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood’s card.\\n\\nOn Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to\\ndetermine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his\\nmother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the\\nfirst time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!—she hardly\\nknew how she could bear it!\\n\\nThese apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and\\ncertainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her\\nown recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to\\nbe inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward\\ncertainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to\\nbe carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept\\naway by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal\\nwhen they were together.\\n\\nThe important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies\\nto this formidable mother-in-law.\\n\\n“Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!” said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs\\ntogether—for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,\\nthat they all followed the servant at the same time:—“there is nobody\\nhere but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good\\ngracious! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness\\ndepends on—that is to be my mother!”\\n\\nElinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the\\npossibility of its being Miss Morton’s mother, rather than her own,\\nwhom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured\\nher, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her—to the utter\\namazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at\\nleast to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in\\nher figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. Her\\ncomplexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and\\nnaturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had\\nrescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it\\nthe strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of\\nmany words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the\\nnumber of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not\\none fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited\\ndetermination of disliking her at all events.\\n\\nElinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months\\nago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars’\\npower to distress her by it now; and the difference of her manners to\\nthe Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble\\nher more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see the\\ngraciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person—for\\nLucy was particularly distinguished—whom of all others, had they known\\nas much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while\\nshe herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat\\npointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a graciousness so\\nmisapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which\\nit sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss\\nSteeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all\\nfour.\\n\\nLucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss\\nSteele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.\\n\\nThe dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing\\nbespoke the Mistress’s inclination for show, and the Master’s ability\\nto support it. In spite of the improvements and additions which were\\nmaking to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once\\nbeen within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a\\nloss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to\\ninfer from it;—no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,\\nappeared—but there, the deficiency was considerable. John Dashwood had\\nnot much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had\\nstill less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was very\\nmuch the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured\\nunder one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable—Want\\nof sense, either natural or improved—want of elegance—want of\\nspirits—or want of temper.\\n\\nWhen the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty\\nwas particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the\\ndiscourse with some variety—the variety of politics, inclosing land,\\nand breaking horses—but then it was all over; and one subject only\\nengaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative\\nheights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton’s second son William, who\\nwere nearly of the same age.\\n\\nHad both the children been there, the affair might have been determined\\ntoo easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it\\nwas all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right\\nto be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over\\nagain as often as they liked.\\n\\nThe parties stood thus:\\n\\nThe two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the\\ntallest, politely decided in favour of the other.\\n\\nThe two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,\\nwere equally earnest in support of their own descendant.\\n\\nLucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,\\nthought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not\\nconceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world\\nbetween them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as\\nfast as she could, in favour of each.\\n\\nElinor, having once delivered her opinion on William’s side, by which\\nshe offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the\\nnecessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when\\ncalled on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no\\nopinion to give, as she had never thought about it.\\n\\nBefore her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair\\nof screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and\\nbrought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,\\ncatching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen\\ninto the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for\\nhis admiration.\\n\\n“These are done by my eldest sister,” said he; “and you, as a man of\\ntaste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether\\nyou have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she\\nis in general reckoned to draw extremely well.”\\n\\nThe Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,\\nwarmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by\\nMiss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course\\nexcited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,\\nnot aware of their being Elinor’s work, particularly requested to look\\nat them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady\\nMiddletons’s approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,\\nconsiderately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by\\nMiss Dashwood.\\n\\n“Hum”—said Mrs. Ferrars—“very pretty,”—and without regarding them at\\nall, returned them to her daughter.\\n\\nPerhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude\\nenough,—for, colouring a little, she immediately said,\\n\\n“They are very pretty, ma’am—an’t they?” But then again, the dread of\\nhaving been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her,\\nfor she presently added,\\n\\n“Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton’s style of\\npainting, Ma’am?—_She does_ paint most delightfully!—How beautifully\\nher last landscape is done!”\\n\\n“Beautifully indeed! But _she_ does every thing well.”\\n\\nMarianne could not bear this.—She was already greatly displeased with\\nMrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor’s\\nexpense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by\\nit, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,\\n\\n“This is admiration of a very particular kind!—what is Miss Morton to\\nus?—who knows, or who cares, for her?—it is Elinor of whom _we_ think\\nand speak.”\\n\\nAnd so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law’s hands,\\nto admire them herself as they ought to be admired.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more\\nstiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, “Miss\\nMorton is Lord Morton’s daughter.”\\n\\nFanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his\\nsister’s audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne’s warmth than\\nshe had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon’s eyes, as they\\nwere fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable\\nin it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister\\nslighted in the smallest point.\\n\\nMarianne’s feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.\\nFerrars’s general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell\\nsuch difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart\\ntaught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister’s\\nchair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,\\nsaid in a low, but eager, voice,\\n\\n“Dear, dear Elinor, don’t mind them. Don’t let them make _you_\\nunhappy.”\\n\\nShe could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her\\nface on Elinor’s shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body’s attention\\nwas called, and almost every body was concerned.—Colonel Brandon rose\\nup and went to them without knowing what he did.—Mrs. Jennings, with a\\nvery intelligent “Ah! poor dear,” immediately gave her her salts; and\\nSir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous\\ndistress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy\\nSteele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole\\nshocking affair.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end\\nto the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained\\nthe impression of what had passed, the whole evening.\\n\\n“Poor Marianne!” said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,\\nas soon as he could secure his attention: “She has not such good health\\nas her sister,—she is very nervous,—she has not Elinor’s\\nconstitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to\\na young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her personal\\nattractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_\\nremarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now\\nyou see it is all gone.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\n\\nElinor’s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found in\\nher every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between\\nthe families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her\\nmeanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend\\nall the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and\\nretarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise\\nfree; and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her _own_ sake,\\nthat one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other\\nof Mrs. Ferrars’s creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her\\ncaprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least, if she\\ndid not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward’s being fettered to\\nLucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she _ought_ to\\nhave rejoiced.\\n\\nShe wondered that Lucy’s spirits could be so very much elevated by the\\ncivility of Mrs. Ferrars;—that her interest and her vanity should so\\nvery much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her\\nbecause she was _not Elinor_, appear a compliment to herself—or to\\nallow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her,\\nbecause her real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not\\nonly been declared by Lucy’s eyes at the time, but was declared over\\nagain the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady\\nMiddleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing\\nElinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.\\n\\nThe chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon\\nafter she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.\\n\\n“My dear friend,” cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, “I\\ncome to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering as\\nMrs. Ferrars’s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable as\\nshe was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her; but the\\nvery moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her\\nbehaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to\\nme. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck\\nwith it?”\\n\\n“She was certainly very civil to you.”\\n\\n“Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility?—I saw a vast deal more.\\nSuch kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride, no\\nhauteur, and your sister just the same—all sweetness and affability!”\\n\\nElinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to\\nown that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go\\non.\\n\\n“Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,” said she, “nothing\\ncould be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was\\nnot the case—”\\n\\n“I guessed you would say so,”—replied Lucy quickly—“but there was no\\nreason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did\\nnot, and her liking me is every thing. You shan’t talk me out of my\\nsatisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no\\ndifficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a\\ncharming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,\\nindeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.\\nDashwood was!”\\n\\nTo this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.\\n\\n“Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?—you seem low—you don’t speak;—sure you\\nan’t well.”\\n\\n“I never was in better health.”\\n\\n“I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I\\nshould be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest\\ncomfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done\\nwithout your friendship.”\\n\\nElinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.\\nBut it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,\\n\\n“Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to\\nEdward’s love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward! But now\\nthere is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty\\noften, for Lady Middleton’s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall\\nbe a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his\\ntime with his sister—besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will\\nvisit now;—and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\\nmore than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are such\\ncharming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of\\nher, you cannot speak too high.”\\n\\nBut Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she\\n_should_ tell her sister. Lucy continued.\\n\\n“I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took\\na dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for\\ninstance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of\\nme, and never looked at me in a pleasant way—you know what I mean—if I\\nhad been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave it\\nall up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where she _does_\\ndislike, I know it is most violent.”\\n\\nElinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by\\nthe door’s being thrown open, the servant’s announcing Mr. Ferrars, and\\nEdward’s immediately walking in.\\n\\nIt was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that\\nit was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to\\nhave as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to\\nadvance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest\\nform, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen\\non them.—They were not only all three together, but were together\\nwithout the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered themselves\\nfirst. It was not Lucy’s business to put herself forward, and the\\nappearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could therefore only\\n_look_ her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more.\\n\\nBut Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her\\nown, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment’s\\nrecollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost\\neasy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still\\nimproved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the\\nconsciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from\\nsaying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much\\nregretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.\\nShe would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as\\na friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of\\nLucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.\\n\\nHer manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough\\nto sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in\\na proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might\\nmake it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy’s, nor\\ncould his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor’s.\\n\\nLucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no\\ncontribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;\\nand almost every thing that _was_ said, proceeded from Elinor, who was\\nobliged to volunteer all the information about her mother’s health,\\ntheir coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,\\nbut never did.\\n\\nHer exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself\\nso heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching\\nMarianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and\\n_that_ in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes\\non the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she\\nwent to her sister. When that was once done, however, it was time for\\nthe raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne’s joy hurried her into\\nthe drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing him was like every\\nother of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken. She met\\nhim with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the\\naffection of a sister.\\n\\n“Dear Edward!” she cried, “this is a moment of great happiness!—This\\nwould almost make amends for every thing!”\\n\\nEdward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such\\nwitnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all sat\\ndown, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was\\nlooking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and\\nsometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other\\nshould be checked by Lucy’s unwelcome presence. Edward was the first to\\nspeak, and it was to notice Marianne’s altered looks, and express his\\nfear of her not finding London agree with her.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t think of me!” she replied with spirited earnestness, though\\nher eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, “don’t think of _my_\\nhealth. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.”\\n\\nThis remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor\\nto conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no\\nvery benignant expression.\\n\\n“Do you like London?” said Edward, willing to say any thing that might\\nintroduce another subject.\\n\\n“Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. The\\nsight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank\\nHeaven! you are what you always were!”\\n\\nShe paused—no one spoke.\\n\\n“I think, Elinor,” she presently added, “we must employ Edward to take\\ncare of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we\\nshall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to\\naccept the charge.”\\n\\nPoor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even\\nhimself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace it\\nto whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and\\nsoon talked of something else.\\n\\n“We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so\\nwretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head, which\\ncannot be said now.”\\n\\nAnd with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her\\nfinding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her\\nbeing particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in\\nprivate.\\n\\n“But why were you not there, Edward?—Why did you not come?”\\n\\n“I was engaged elsewhere.”\\n\\n“Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?”\\n\\n“Perhaps, Miss Marianne,” cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on\\nher, “you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no\\nmind to keep them, little as well as great.”\\n\\nElinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the\\nsting; for she calmly replied,\\n\\n“Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\\nconscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he\\n_has_ the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in\\nperforming every engagement, however minute, and however it may make\\nagainst his interest or pleasure. He is the most fearful of giving\\npain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,\\nof any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will say it. What! are\\nyou never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine;\\nfor those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open\\ncommendation.”\\n\\nThe nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened\\nto be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her\\nauditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon\\ngot up to go away.\\n\\n“Going so soon!” said Marianne; “my dear Edward, this must not be.”\\n\\nAnd drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy\\ncould not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he\\nwould go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours, soon afterwards went away.\\n\\n“What can bring her here so often?” said Marianne, on her leaving them.\\n“Could not she see that we wanted her gone!—how teazing to Edward!”\\n\\n“Why so?—we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known\\nto him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as well\\nas ourselves.”\\n\\nMarianne looked at her steadily, and said, “You know, Elinor, that this\\nis a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to have your\\nassertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to\\nrecollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I cannot\\ndescend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted.”\\n\\nShe then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,\\nfor bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give\\nno information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the\\nconsequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was\\nobliged to submit to it. All that she could hope, was that Edward would\\nnot often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne’s\\nmistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain\\nthat had attended their recent meeting—and this she had every reason to\\nexpect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\n\\nWithin a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\\nworld, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\\nson and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\\nto all those intimate connections who knew it before.\\n\\nThis event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings’s happiness, produced a\\ntemporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\\nlike degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to\\nbe as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning\\nas soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the\\nevening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\\nMiddletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their\\nown comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the\\nmorning, in Mrs. Jennings’s house; but it was not a thing to be urged\\nagainst the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over\\nto Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in\\nfact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.\\n\\nThey had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\\nby the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\\n_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to\\nmonopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton’s\\nbehaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.\\nBecause they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not\\nbelieve them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she\\nfancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to\\nbe satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common use,\\nand easily given.\\n\\nTheir presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked the\\nidleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was\\nashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\\nproud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\\ndespise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\\nthree, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to\\nit entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and minute\\naccount of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she\\nwould have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best\\nplace by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. But\\nthis conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out\\nexpressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt\\na reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was\\nproduced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in\\nthe latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her their\\nfriend. Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But so\\nlittle were they, any more than the others, inclined to oblige her,\\nthat if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without\\nhearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind\\nenough to bestow on herself.\\n\\nAll these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally\\nunsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing\\nfor the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young\\nfriends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old\\nwoman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John’s, sometimes at\\nher own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent\\nspirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte’s well\\ndoing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail\\nof her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.\\nOne thing _did_ disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.\\nMr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex,\\nof all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at\\ndifferent times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and\\nevery one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his\\nfather of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like\\nevery other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to\\nacknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the\\nworld.\\n\\nI come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time\\nbefell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisters\\nwith Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another\\nof her acquaintance had dropt in—a circumstance in itself not\\napparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations of\\nother people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our\\nconduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one’s happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present\\ninstance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun\\ntruth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss\\nDashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood’s sisters, she\\nimmediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\\nmisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\\ninvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small\\nmusical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs.\\nJohn Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great\\ninconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what\\nwas still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\\nto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not\\nexpect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing\\nthem, it was true, must always be hers. But that was not enough; for\\nwhen people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be\\nwrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from\\nthem.\\n\\nMarianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\\ngoing out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\\nher, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically\\nfor every evening’s engagement, though without expecting the smallest\\namusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last\\nmoment, where it was to take her.\\n\\nTo her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as\\nnot to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her\\ntoilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of\\ntheir being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her_\\nminute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and\\nasked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part\\nof Marianne’s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns\\naltogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not\\nwithout hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing\\ncost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.\\nThe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\\nconcluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was\\nconsidered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after\\nundergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the\\ncolour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost\\nsure of being told that upon “her word she looked vastly smart, and she\\ndared to say she would make a great many conquests.”\\n\\nWith such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present\\noccasion, to her brother’s carriage; which they were ready to enter\\nfive minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very\\nagreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of\\nher acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part\\nthat might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.\\n\\nThe events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like\\nother musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real\\ntaste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;\\nand the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\\nand that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in\\nEngland.\\n\\nAs Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no\\nscruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it\\nsuited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and\\nvioloncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the\\nroom. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of\\nyoung men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases\\nat Gray’s. She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and\\nspeaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out\\nhis name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr.\\nDashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.\\n\\nHe addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow\\nwhich assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was\\nexactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy\\nhad it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his\\nown merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his\\nbrother’s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the\\nill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while she\\nwondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that\\nthe emptiness and conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with\\nthe modesty and worth of the other. Why they _were_ different, Robert\\nexplained to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour’s\\nconversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme\\n_gaucherie_ which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper\\nsociety, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any\\nnatural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;\\nwhile he himself, though probably without any particular, any material\\nsuperiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.\\n\\n“Upon my soul,” he added, “I believe it is nothing more; and so I often\\ntell my mother, when she is grieving about it. ‘My dear Madam,’ I\\nalways say to her, ‘you must make yourself easy. The evil is now\\nirremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you be\\npersuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place\\nEdward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his life? If\\nyou had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of\\nsending him to Mr. Pratt’s, all this would have been prevented.’ This\\nis the way in which I always consider the matter, and my mother is\\nperfectly convinced of her error.”\\n\\nElinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her\\ngeneral estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not\\nthink of Edward’s abode in Mr. Pratt’s family, with any satisfaction.\\n\\n“You reside in Devonshire, I think,”—was his next observation, “in a\\ncottage near Dawlish.”\\n\\nElinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather\\nsurprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living\\nnear Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\\nspecies of house.\\n\\n“For my own part,” said he, “I am excessively fond of a cottage; there\\nis always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,\\nif I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one\\nmyself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself\\ndown at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I\\nadvise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend\\nLord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,\\nand laid before me three different plans of Bonomi’s. I was to decide\\non the best of them. ‘My dear Courtland,’ said I, immediately throwing\\nthem all into the fire, ‘do not adopt either of them, but by all means\\nbuild a cottage.’ And that I fancy, will be the end of it.\\n\\n“Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a\\ncottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend\\nElliott’s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. ‘But how\\ncan it be done?’ said she; ‘my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be\\nmanaged. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple,\\nand where can the supper be?’ _I_ immediately saw that there could be\\nno difficulty in it, so I said, ‘My dear Lady Elliott, do not be\\nuneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;\\ncard-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open\\nfor tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the\\nsaloon.’ Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the\\ndining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the\\naffair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you see,\\nif people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well\\nenjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.”\\n\\nElinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the\\ncompliment of rational opposition.\\n\\nAs John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,\\nhis mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought\\nstruck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for\\nher approbation, when they got home. The consideration of Mrs.\\nDennison’s mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had\\nsuggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,\\nwhile Mrs. Jennings’s engagements kept her from home. The expense would\\nbe nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an\\nattention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be\\nrequisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his\\nfather. Fanny was startled at the proposal.\\n\\n“I do not see how it can be done,” said she, “without affronting Lady\\nMiddleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be\\nexceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any\\nattention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But\\nthey are Lady Middleton’s visitors. How can I ask them away from her?”\\n\\nHer husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her\\nobjection. “They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit\\nStreet, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the\\nsame number of days to such near relations.”\\n\\nFanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,\\n\\n“My love, I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.\\nBut I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a\\nfew days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I\\nthink the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well by\\nEdward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the Miss\\nSteeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like them;\\nindeed, you _do_ like them, you know, very much already, and so does my\\nmother; and they are such favourites with Harry!”\\n\\nMr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss\\nSteeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution\\nof inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly\\nsuspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by\\nbringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon’s wife, and Marianne as\\n_their_ visitor.\\n\\nFanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had\\nprocured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company and\\nher sister’s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady\\nMiddleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and\\nreasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,\\nherself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such an\\nopportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all things,\\nthe most material to her interest, and such an invitation the most\\ngratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not be too\\ngratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the visit to\\nLady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was\\ninstantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days’\\ntime.\\n\\nWhen the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after\\nits arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the\\nexpectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed\\non so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will\\ntowards her arose from something more than merely malice against\\nherself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing\\nthat Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady\\nMiddleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John\\nDashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of\\ngreater.\\n\\nThe Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor\\nof their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.\\nSir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts\\nof the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. Mrs.\\nDashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her\\nlife, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made\\nby some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know\\nwhether she should ever be able to part with them.\\n\\nEND OF THE SECOND VOLUME\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt\\nit no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and,\\ncontenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from\\nthat period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found the\\nMiss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.\\n\\nAbout the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in\\nBerkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to\\nMrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by\\nherself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to\\nhear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,\\nbegan directly to justify it, by saying,\\n\\n“Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?”\\n\\n“No, ma’am. What is it?”\\n\\n“Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.\\nPalmer’s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was\\nsure it was very ill—it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.\\nSo I looked at it directly, and, ‘Lord! my dear,’ says I, ‘it is\\nnothing in the world, but the red gum;’ and nurse said just the same.\\nBut Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;\\nand luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he\\nstepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said\\njust as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and\\nthen Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it\\ncame into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of\\nit, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So upon\\nthat, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know\\nsomething or other, and at last he said in a whisper, ‘For fear any\\nunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to\\ntheir sister’s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I\\nbelieve there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will\\ndo very well.’”\\n\\n“What! is Fanny ill?”\\n\\n“That is exactly what I said, my dear. ‘Lord!’ says I, ‘is Mrs.\\nDashwood ill?’ So then it all came out; and the long and the short of\\nthe matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,\\nthe very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it\\nturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.\\nEdward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my\\ncousin Lucy!—There’s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a\\nsyllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a\\nthing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody\\nsuspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,\\nor I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was\\nkept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your\\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very\\nmorning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no\\nconjurer, popt it all out. ‘Lord!’ thinks she to herself, ‘they are all\\nso fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;’ and\\nso, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her\\ncarpet-work, little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been\\nsaying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to\\nmake a match between Edward and some Lord’s daughter or other, I forget\\nwho. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.\\nShe fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as\\nreached your brother’s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room\\ndown stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the\\ncountry. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for\\nLucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.\\nPoor soul! I pity _her_. And I must say, I think she was used very\\nhardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into\\na fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and\\nyour brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what\\nto do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in\\nthe house, and your brother was forced to go down upon _his_ knees too,\\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes.\\n_Then_ she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he\\nwould send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this\\nuproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins\\naway, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such\\na condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost\\nas bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,\\nwith all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a\\ntaking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love\\nused so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well\\nhe may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest\\npassion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great\\ndeal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back\\nagain to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is\\ntold of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the\\nhouse, for your sister was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so\\nshe may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no\\nnotion of people’s making such a to-do about money and greatness. There\\nis no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I\\nam sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though\\nLucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to\\nmake the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only\\nallow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance\\nwith it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might\\nlive in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two\\nmaids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for\\nmy Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.”\\n\\nHere Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect\\nher thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such\\nobservations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.\\nHappy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest\\nin it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the\\ncase) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy\\nabove all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able\\nto speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment,\\nas she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one\\nconcerned in it.\\n\\nShe could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really\\nwas; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being\\npossible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and\\nLucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a\\ndoubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to\\nknow how Edward would conduct himself. For _him_ she felt much\\ncompassion;—for Lucy very little—and it cost her some pains to procure\\nthat little;—for the rest of the party none at all.\\n\\nAs Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the\\nnecessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be\\nlost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,\\nand in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any\\nresentment against Edward.\\n\\nElinor’s office was a painful one.—She was going to remove what she\\nreally believed to be her sister’s chief consolation,—to give such\\nparticulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good\\nopinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,\\nwhich to _her_ fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment\\nover again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to\\nbe done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.\\n\\nShe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to\\nrepresent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the\\nself-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward’s\\nengagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.\\nHer narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given\\nwithout emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor\\nimpetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne\\nlistened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the\\ncomforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and\\nall the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure\\nof mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but\\nof imprudence, was readily offered.\\n\\nBut Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed\\na second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she _had_\\nloved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for Lucy\\nSteele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded\\nat first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of\\nEdward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; and\\nElinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only\\ncould convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.\\n\\nHer first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact\\nof the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.—Marianne’s\\nfeelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of\\ndetail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her\\ndistress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. The first\\nquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,—\\n\\n“How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?”\\n\\n“I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton Park\\nlast November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.”\\n\\nAt these words, Marianne’s eyes expressed the astonishment which her\\nlips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed—\\n\\n“Four months!—Have you known of this four months?”\\n\\nElinor confirmed it.\\n\\n“What! while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your\\nheart? And I have reproached you for being happy!”\\n\\n“It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!”\\n\\n“Four months!” cried Marianne again. “So calm! so cheerful! How have\\nyou been supported?”\\n\\n“By feeling that I was doing my duty.—My promise to Lucy, obliged me to\\nbe secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the\\ntruth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a\\nsolicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy.”\\n\\nMarianne seemed much struck.\\n\\n“I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,” added\\nElinor; “and once or twice I have attempted it;—but without betraying\\nmy trust, I never could have convinced you.”\\n\\n“Four months! and yet you loved him!”\\n\\n“Yes. But I did not love only him; and while the comfort of others was\\ndear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. Now,\\nI can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have you\\nsuffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially\\nmyself. I have many things to support me. I am not conscious of having\\nprovoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne\\nit as much as possible without spreading it farther. I acquit Edward of\\nessential misconduct. I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his\\nalways doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in\\nthe end he must become so. Lucy does not want sense, and that is the\\nfoundation on which every thing good may be built. And after all,\\nMarianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and\\nconstant attachment, and all that can be said of one’s happiness\\ndepending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant—it is not\\nfit—it is not possible that it should be so. Edward will marry Lucy; he\\nwill marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her\\nsex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\\nanother superior to _her_.”\\n\\n“If such is your way of thinking,” said Marianne, “if the loss of what\\nis most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your\\nresolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\\nwondered at.—They are brought more within my comprehension.”\\n\\n“I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For\\nfour months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without\\nbeing at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it\\nwould make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to\\nyou, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told me,—it\\nwas in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior\\nengagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with\\ntriumph. This person’s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by\\nendeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply\\ninterested; and it has not been only once; I have had her hopes and\\nexultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be\\ndivided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that\\ncould make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him\\nunworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.  I have had\\nto contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of\\nhis mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without\\nenjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,\\nwhen, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you\\ncan think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I\\nhave suffered _now_. The composure of mind with which I have brought\\nmyself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have\\nbeen willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful\\nexertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to\\nrelieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. _Then_, if I had not been\\nbound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely—not even\\nwhat I owed to my dearest friends—from openly showing that I was _very_\\nunhappy.”\\n\\nMarianne was quite subdued.\\n\\n“Oh! Elinor,” she cried, “you have made me hate myself for ever.—How\\nbarbarous have I been to you!—you, who have been my only comfort, who\\nhave borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only\\nsuffering for me!—Is this my gratitude?—Is this the only return I can\\nmake you?—Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying\\nto do it away.”\\n\\nThe tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of\\nmind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her\\nwhatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of\\nbitterness; to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of\\ndislike to her; and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring\\nthem together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality. These\\nwere great concessions; but where Marianne felt that she had injured,\\nno reparation could be too much for her to make.\\n\\nShe performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.—She\\nattended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an\\nunchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard\\nthree times to say, “Yes, ma’am.”—She listened to her praise of Lucy\\nwith only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings\\ntalked of Edward’s affection, it cost her only a spasm in her\\nthroat.—Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel\\nequal to any thing herself.\\n\\nThe next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their\\nbrother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful\\naffair, and bring them news of his wife.\\n\\n“You have heard, I suppose,” said he with great solemnity, as soon as\\nhe was seated, “of the very shocking discovery that took place under\\nour roof yesterday.”\\n\\nThey all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.\\n\\n“Your sister,” he continued, “has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars\\ntoo—in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress—but I\\nwill hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us\\nquite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I\\nwould not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing materially\\nto be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution\\nequal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an\\nangel! She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one\\ncannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!—meeting with such\\ningratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much confidence\\nhad been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that\\nshe had asked these young women to her house; merely because she\\nthought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved\\ngirls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished\\nvery much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your\\nkind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to be so\\nrewarded! ‘I wish, with all my heart,’ says poor Fanny in her\\naffectionate way, ‘that we had asked your sisters instead of them.’”\\n\\nHere he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.\\n\\n“What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is\\nnot to be described. While she with the truest affection had been\\nplanning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that\\nhe could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a\\nsuspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected _any_\\nprepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_ quarter. ‘_There_,\\nto be sure,’ said she, ‘I might have thought myself safe.’ She was\\nquite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be\\ndone, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am\\nsorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make\\nhim put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose\\nby my arguments, and Fanny’s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty,\\naffection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so\\nstubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal\\ndesigns, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle\\non him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good\\nthousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it\\ntwelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in\\nthis low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must\\nattend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be\\nhis all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from\\naffording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into\\nany profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her\\npower to prevent him advancing in it.”\\n\\nHere Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands\\ntogether, and cried, “Gracious God! can this be possible!”\\n\\n“Well may you wonder, Marianne,” replied her brother, “at the obstinacy\\nwhich could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation is very\\nnatural.”\\n\\nMarianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and\\nforbore.\\n\\n“All this, however,” he continued, “was urged in vain. Edward said very\\nlittle; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner. Nothing\\nshould prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would stand to it,\\ncost him what it might.”\\n\\n“Then,” cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be\\nsilent, “he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.\\nDashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a\\nrascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as\\nyourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a\\nbetter kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good\\nhusband.”\\n\\nJohn Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open\\nto provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially\\nanybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any resentment,\\n\\n“I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,\\nmadam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,\\nbut in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.\\nAnd to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her\\nuncle’s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune\\nas Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In\\nshort, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom\\nyou have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish her extremely happy;\\nand Mrs. Ferrars’s conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every\\nconscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt. It has\\nbeen dignified and liberal. Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear it\\nwill be a bad one.”\\n\\nMarianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor’s heart wrung\\nfor the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother’s threats, for a\\nwoman who could not reward him.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” said Mrs. Jennings, “and how did it end?”\\n\\n“I am sorry to say, ma’am, in a most unhappy rupture:—Edward is\\ndismissed for ever from his mother’s notice. He left her house\\nyesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do\\nnot know; for _we_ of course can make no inquiry.”\\n\\n“Poor young man!—and what is to become of him?”\\n\\n“What, indeed, ma’am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the\\nprospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more\\ndeplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds—how can a man live on\\nit?—and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for\\nhis own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand\\npounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must\\nall feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our\\npower to assist him.”\\n\\n“Poor young man!” cried Mrs. Jennings, “I am sure he should be very\\nwelcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I\\ncould see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own\\ncharge now, at lodgings and taverns.”\\n\\nElinor’s heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she\\ncould not forbear smiling at the form of it.\\n\\n“If he would only have done as well by himself,” said John Dashwood,\\n“as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been\\nin his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it\\nis, it must be out of anybody’s power to assist him. And there is one\\nthing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all—his\\nmother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle\\n_that_ estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward’s,\\non proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking\\nover the business.”\\n\\n“Well!” said Mrs. Jennings, “that is _her_ revenge. Everybody has a way\\nof their own. But I don’t think mine would be, to make one son\\nindependent, because another had plagued me.”\\n\\nMarianne got up and walked about the room.\\n\\n“Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,” continued John,\\n“than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might\\nhave been his own? Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely.”\\n\\nA few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his\\nvisit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really\\nbelieved there was no material danger in Fanny’s indisposition, and\\nthat they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present\\noccasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars’s conduct, the\\nDashwoods’, and Edward’s.\\n\\nMarianne’s indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and\\nas her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in\\nMrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the\\nparty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward’s conduct, but only\\nElinor and Marianne understood its true merit. _They_ only knew how\\nlittle he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the\\nconsolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain\\nto him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried in his\\nintegrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his\\npunishment. But though confidence between them was, by this public\\ndiscovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which\\neither of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it upon\\nprinciple, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too\\nwarm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward’s\\ncontinued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and\\nMarianne’s courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic\\nwhich always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the\\ncomparison it necessarily produced between Elinor’s conduct and her\\nown.\\n\\nShe felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had\\nhoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of\\ncontinual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never\\nexerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\\nwithout the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that she\\nstill fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only\\ndispirited her more.\\n\\nNothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs\\nin Harley Street, or Bartlett’s Buildings. But though so much of the\\nmatter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had\\nenough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after\\nmore, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and\\ninquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the\\nhindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them\\nwithin that time.\\n\\nThe third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so\\nfine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,\\nthough it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor\\nwere of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were\\nagain in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather\\nto stay at home, than venture into so public a place.\\n\\nAn intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they\\nentered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing\\nwith them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings’s conversation, she was\\nherself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\\nnothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by\\nany chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last she\\nfound herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though\\nlooking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and\\non receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs.\\nJennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their’s. Mrs.\\nJennings immediately whispered to Elinor,\\n\\n“Get it all out of her, my dear. She will tell you any thing if you\\nask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.”\\n\\nIt was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings’s curiosity and Elinor’s too,\\nthat she would tell any thing _without_ being asked; for nothing would\\notherwise have been learnt.\\n\\n“I am so glad to meet you;” said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by\\nthe arm—“for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.” And then\\nlowering her voice, “I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. Is\\nshe angry?”\\n\\n“Not at all, I believe, with you.”\\n\\n“That is a good thing. And Lady Middleton, is _she_ angry?”\\n\\n“I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.”\\n\\n“I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of\\nit! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she\\nwould never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me\\nagain, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are\\nas good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put\\nin the feather last night. There now, _you_ are going to laugh at me\\ntoo. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it _is_\\nthe Doctor’s favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never\\nhave known he _did_ like it better than any other colour, if he had not\\nhappened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare\\nsometimes I do not know which way to look before them.”\\n\\nShe had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,\\nand therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to\\nthe first.\\n\\n“Well, but Miss Dashwood,” speaking triumphantly, “people may say what\\nthey chuse about Mr. Ferrars’s declaring he would not have Lucy, for it\\nis no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such\\nill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think\\nabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set\\nit down for certain.”\\n\\n“I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,”\\nsaid Elinor.\\n\\n“Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\\nthan one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\\ncould expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\\nthirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing\\nat all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my\\ncousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was\\nafraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us\\nfor three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in\\nmy heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your\\nbrother’s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday,\\nFriday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once\\nLucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.\\nHowever this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then\\nit all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had\\ndeclared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but\\nLucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that\\nas soon as he had went away from his mother’s house, he had got upon\\nhis horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he\\nhad stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get\\nthe better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he\\nsaid, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at\\nall, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because\\nit must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds,\\nand no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he\\nhad some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they\\nto live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better,\\nand so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to\\nthe matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say\\nall this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for _her_\\nsake, and upon _her_ account, that he said a word about being off, and\\nnot upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of\\nbeing tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing\\nlike it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of\\ntalking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and\\nlove, you know, and all that—Oh, la! one can’t repeat such kind of\\nthings you know)—she told him directly, she had not the least mind in\\nthe world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how\\nlittle so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all,\\nyou know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and\\ntalked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he\\nshould take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he\\ngot a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\\ncalled from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and\\nwould take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into\\nthe room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but\\nshe did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a\\npair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.”\\n\\n“I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,” said Elinor;\\n“you were all in the same room together, were not you?”\\n\\n“No, indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love\\nwhen any body else is by? Oh, for shame!—To be sure you must know\\nbetter than that. (Laughing affectedly.)—No, no; they were shut up in\\nthe drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the\\ndoor.”\\n\\n“How!” cried Elinor; “have you been repeating to me what you only\\nlearnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it\\nbefore; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me\\nparticulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known\\nyourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?”\\n\\n“Oh, la! there is nothing in _that_. I only stood at the door, and\\nheard what I could. And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by\\nme; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many\\nsecrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or\\nbehind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.”\\n\\nElinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be\\nkept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.\\n\\n“Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,” said she; “but now he is\\nlodging at No.—, Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is,\\nan’t she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I\\nshan’t say anything against them to _you;_ and to be sure they did send\\nus home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for. And for\\nmy part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for\\nthe huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however, nothing\\nwas said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight. Edward\\nhave got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a\\ntime; and after _that_, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will\\nbe ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get! Good gracious! (giggling\\nas she spoke) I’d lay my life I know what my cousins will say, when\\nthey hear of it. They will tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get\\nEdward the curacy of his new living. I know they will; but I am sure I\\nwould not do such a thing for all the world. ‘La!’ I shall say\\ndirectly, ‘I wonder how you could think of such a thing? _I_ write to\\nthe Doctor, indeed!’”\\n\\n“Well,” said Elinor, “it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.\\nYou have got your answer ready.”\\n\\nMiss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of\\nher own party made another more necessary.\\n\\n“Oh, la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to\\nyou, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you\\nthey are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and\\nthey keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings\\nabout it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not\\nin anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything\\nshould happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings\\nshould want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay\\nwith her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton\\nwon’t ask us any more this bout. Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was\\nnot here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your\\nspotted muslin on!—I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.”\\n\\nSuch was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay\\nher farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was\\nclaimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of\\nknowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though\\nshe had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and\\nforeplanned in her own mind. Edward’s marriage with Lucy was as firmly\\ndetermined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely\\nuncertain, as she had concluded it would be;—every thing depended,\\nexactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of\\nwhich, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.\\n\\nAs soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for\\ninformation; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible\\nintelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she\\nconfined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as\\nshe felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, would\\nchoose to have known. The continuance of their engagement, and the\\nmeans that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her\\ncommunication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following\\nnatural remark.\\n\\n“Wait for his having a living!—ay, we all know how _that_ will\\nend:—they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,\\nwill set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest\\nof his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.\\nPratt can give her. Then they will have a child every year! and Lord\\nhelp ’em! how poor they will be! I must see what I can give them\\ntowards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed! as I\\ntalked of t’ other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all\\nworks. Betty’s sister would never do for them _now_.”\\n\\nThe next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from\\nLucy herself. It was as follows:\\n\\n“Bartlett’s Building, March.\\n\\n\\n“I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing\\nto her; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear\\nsuch a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after all the\\ntroubles we have went through lately, therefore will make no more\\napologies, but proceed to say that, thank God! though we have suffered\\ndreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always\\nbe in one another’s love. We have had great trials, and great\\npersecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge\\nmany friends, yourself not the least among them, whose great kindness I\\nshall always thankfully remember, as will Edward too, who I have told\\nof it. I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs.\\nJennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon, he\\nwould not hear of our parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my\\nduty required, urge him to it for prudence sake, and would have parted\\nfor ever on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should\\nnever be, he did not regard his mother’s anger, while he could have my\\naffections; our prospects are not very bright, to be sure, but we must\\nwait, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it\\never be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to\\nbestow, am very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings\\ntoo, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or Mr.\\nPalmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.—Poor Anne was much\\nto blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say\\nnothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won’t think it too much trouble to give us\\na call, should she come this way any morning, ’twould be a great\\nkindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her.—My paper reminds\\nme to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully\\nremembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear\\nchildren, when you chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,\\n\\n\\n“I am, &c.”\\n\\n\\nAs soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to\\nbe its writer’s real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.\\nJennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and\\npraise.\\n\\n“Very well indeed!—how prettily she writes!—aye, that was quite proper\\nto let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy. Poor soul! I\\nwish I _could_ get him a living, with all my heart. She calls me dear\\nMrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived. Very\\nwell upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned. Yes, yes, I\\nwill go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to think of\\nevery body!—Thank you, my dear, for showing it me. It is as pretty a\\nletter as ever I saw, and does Lucy’s head and heart great credit.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\n\\nThe Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,\\nand Marianne’s impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed\\nfor the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if\\nany place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent\\non its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the\\ndifficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought\\nto acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts\\ntowards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to\\ntheir kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her\\ngood-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from\\nhome yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more\\neligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about\\nthe end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both\\nher friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with\\nthem. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy\\nof Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by\\nMr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his\\nmanners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,\\ninduced her to accept it with pleasure.\\n\\nWhen she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was\\nnot very auspicious.\\n\\n“Cleveland!”—she cried, with great agitation. “No, I cannot go to\\nCleveland.”\\n\\n“You forget,” said Elinor gently, “that its situation is not—that it is\\nnot in the neighbourhood of—”\\n\\n“But it is in Somersetshire.—I cannot go into Somersetshire.—There,\\nwhere I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to\\ngo there.”\\n\\nElinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such\\nfeelings;—she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on\\nothers;—represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the\\ntime of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to\\nsee, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan\\ncould do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which\\nwas within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not\\nbeyond one day, though a long day’s journey; and their mother’s servant\\nmight easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no\\noccasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be\\nat home in little more than three weeks’ time. As Marianne’s affection\\nfor her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,\\nover the imaginary evils she had started.\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she\\npressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.\\nElinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her\\ndesign; and their mother’s concurrence being readily gained, every\\nthing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;—and\\nMarianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that\\nwere yet to divide her from Barton.\\n\\n“Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss\\nDashwoods;”—was Mrs. Jennings’s address to him when he first called on\\nher, after their leaving her was settled—“for they are quite resolved\\nupon going home from the Palmers;—and how forlorn we shall be, when I\\ncome back!—Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two\\ncats.”\\n\\nPerhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their\\nfuture ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give\\nhimself an escape from it; and if so, she had soon afterwards good\\nreason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor’s moving to the\\nwindow to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she\\nwas going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of\\nparticular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.\\nThe effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her\\nobservation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\\nchanged her seat, on purpose that she might _not_ hear, to one close by\\nthe piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep\\nherself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with\\nagitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.\\nStill farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of\\nMarianne’s turning from one lesson to another, some words of the\\nColonel’s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be\\napologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a\\ndoubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so; but\\nsupposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply she\\ncould not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she\\ndid not think _that_ any material objection; and Mrs. Jennings\\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest. They then talked on for\\na few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another\\nlucky stop in Marianne’s performance brought her these words in the\\nColonel’s calm voice,—\\n\\n“I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.”\\n\\nAstonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost\\nready to cry out, “Lord! what should hinder it?”—but checking her\\ndesire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.\\n\\n“This is very strange!—sure he need not wait to be older.”\\n\\nThis delay on the Colonel’s side, however, did not seem to offend or\\nmortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the\\nconference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings\\nvery plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her to\\nfeel what she said,\\n\\n“I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.”\\n\\nMrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that\\nafter hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave\\nof them, as he immediately did, with the utmost _sang-froid_, and go\\naway without making her any reply! She had not thought her old friend\\ncould have made so indifferent a suitor.\\n\\nWhat had really passed between them was to this effect.\\n\\n“I have heard,” said he, with great compassion, “of the injustice your\\nfriend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand\\nthe matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\\nin his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have I been\\nrightly informed? Is it so?;”\\n\\nElinor told him that it was.\\n\\n“The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,” he replied, with great feeling,\\n“of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached\\nto each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be\\ndoing—what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or\\nthree times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him. He is not a\\nyoung man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time,\\nbut I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake, and as\\na friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understand that he intends\\nto take orders. Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of\\nDelaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day’s post, is his,\\nif he think it worth his acceptance; but _that_, perhaps, so\\nunfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear\\nto doubt; I only wish it were more valuable. It is a rectory, but a\\nsmall one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than 200£\\nper annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear,\\nnot to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income. Such\\nas it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him, will be very\\ngreat. Pray assure him of it.”\\n\\nElinor’s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been\\ngreater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.\\nThe preferment, which only two days before she had considered as\\nhopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry; and\\n_she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it! Her\\nemotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different\\ncause; but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have\\na share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and\\nher gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted\\nColonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.\\nShe thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward’s principles\\nand disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and\\npromised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really\\nhis wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same\\ntime, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it\\nas himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give\\nEdward the pain of receiving an obligation from _her_, she would have\\nbeen very glad to be spared herself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of\\nequal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its\\nbeing given through her means, that she would not on any account make\\nfarther opposition. Edward, she believed, was still in town, and\\nfortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele. She could\\nundertake therefore to inform him of it, in the course of the day.\\nAfter this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own\\nadvantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and\\n_then_ it was that he mentioned with regret, that the house was small\\nand indifferent; an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed\\nher to do, made very light of, at least as far as regarded its size.\\n\\n“The smallness of the house,” said she, “I cannot imagine any\\ninconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and\\nincome.”\\n\\nBy which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she_ was considering\\nMr. Ferrars’s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;\\nfor he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply\\nsuch an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle\\non, and he said so.\\n\\n“This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable\\nas a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry to say that my\\npatronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive. If,\\nhowever, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him\\nfarther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do, if I\\nam not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be\\nat present. What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, since it\\ncan advance him so little towards what must be his principal, his only\\nobject of happiness. His marriage must still be a distant good; at\\nleast, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.”\\n\\nSuch was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the\\ndelicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what\\nreally passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at\\nthe window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may\\nperhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less\\nproperly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\n\\n“Well, Miss Dashwood,” said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon\\nas the gentleman had withdrawn, “I do not ask you what the Colonel has\\nbeen saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I _tried_ to keep out\\nof hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his\\nbusiness. And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I\\nwish you joy of it with all my heart.”\\n\\n“Thank you, ma’am,” said Elinor. “It _is_ a matter of great joy to me;\\nand I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are not\\nmany men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so\\ncompassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life.”\\n\\n“Lord! my dear, you are very modest. I an’t the least astonished at it\\nin the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more\\nlikely to happen.”\\n\\n“You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel’s general benevolence;\\nbut at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very\\nsoon occur.”\\n\\n“Opportunity!” repeated Mrs. Jennings—“Oh! as to that, when a man has\\nonce made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon\\nfind an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and\\nagain; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I\\nshall soon know where to look for them.”\\n\\n“You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,” said Elinor, with a\\nfaint smile.\\n\\n“Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one,\\nI do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as\\never I saw.”\\n\\n“He spoke of its being out of repair.”\\n\\n“Well, and whose fault is that? why don’t he repair it?—who should do\\nit but himself?”\\n\\nThey were interrupted by the servant’s coming in to announce the\\ncarriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to\\ngo, said,—\\n\\n“Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out. But,\\nhowever, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be quite\\nalone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too\\nfull of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must long to\\ntell your sister all about it.”\\n\\nMarianne had left the room before the conversation began.\\n\\n“Certainly, ma’am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention\\nit at present to any body else.”\\n\\n“Oh! very well,” said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. “Then you\\nwould not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as\\nHolborn to-day.”\\n\\n“No, ma’am, not even Lucy if you please. One day’s delay will not be\\nvery material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought\\nnot to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do _that_ directly. It is\\nof importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of\\ncourse have much to do relative to his ordination.”\\n\\nThis speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr. Ferrars\\nwas to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could not\\nimmediately comprehend. A few moments’ reflection, however, produced a\\nvery happy idea, and she exclaimed;—\\n\\n“Oh, ho!—I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much\\nthe better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness;\\nand I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my\\ndear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel write\\nhimself?—sure, he is the proper person.”\\n\\nElinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings’s\\nspeech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore\\nonly replied to its conclusion.\\n\\n“Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to\\nannounce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.”\\n\\n“And so _you_ are forced to do it. Well _that_ is an odd kind of\\ndelicacy! However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to\\nwrite.) You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I have not\\nheard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to\\nbed.”\\n\\nAnd away she went; but returning again in a moment,\\n\\n“I have just been thinking of Betty’s sister, my dear. I should be very\\nglad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for a\\nlady’s maid, I am sure I can’t tell. She is an excellent housemaid, and\\nworks very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that at\\nyour leisure.”\\n\\n“Certainly, ma’am,” replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,\\nand more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.\\n\\nHow she should begin—how she should express herself in her note to\\nEdward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between\\nthem made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have\\nbeen the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\\nmuch or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\\nin her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\\n\\nHe had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\\ncame to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not\\nreturning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss\\nDashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular\\nbusiness.\\n\\nElinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\\nperplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself\\nproperly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\\ninformation by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\\nupon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion were\\nvery great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him before\\nsince his engagement became public, and therefore not since his knowing\\nher to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of what she\\nhad been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her feel\\nparticularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much\\ndistressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\\nembarrassment.—Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\\nfirst coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\\nbe on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\\nsay any thing, after taking a chair.\\n\\n“Mrs. Jennings told me,” said he, “that you wished to speak with me, at\\nleast I understood her so—or I certainly should not have intruded on\\nyou in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\\nextremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\\nespecially as it will most likely be some time—it is not probable that\\nI should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to Oxford\\ntomorrow.”\\n\\n“You would not have gone, however,” said Elinor, recovering herself,\\nand determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as\\npossible, “without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\\nable to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\\nsaid. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on\\nthe point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most agreeable\\noffice (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.) Colonel\\nBrandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say, that\\nunderstanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure in\\noffering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes it\\nwere more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having so\\nrespectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the\\nliving—it is about two hundred a-year—were much more considerable, and\\nsuch as might better enable you to—as might be more than a temporary\\naccommodation to yourself—such, in short, as might establish all your\\nviews of happiness.”\\n\\nWhat Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected\\nthat any one else should say for him. He _looked_ all the astonishment\\nwhich such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of\\nexciting; but he said only these two words,—\\n\\n“Colonel Brandon!”\\n\\n“Yes,” continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the\\nworst was over, “Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern\\nfor what has lately passed—for the cruel situation in which the\\nunjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you—a concern which I\\nam sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and\\nlikewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and\\nhis particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.”\\n\\n“Colonel Brandon give _me_ a living!—Can it be possible?”\\n\\n“The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find\\nfriendship any where.”\\n\\n“No,” replied he, with sudden consciousness, “not to find it in _you;_\\nfor I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.—I\\nfeel it—I would express it if I could—but, as you well know, I am no\\norator.”\\n\\n“You are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely,\\nat least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon’s\\ndiscernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till\\nI understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever\\noccurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a\\nfriend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps—indeed I know he _has_,\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe\\nnothing to my solicitation.”\\n\\nTruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but\\nshe was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of\\nEdward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably\\ncontributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently\\nentered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had\\nceased to speak;—at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\\n\\n“Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. I have\\nalways heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him\\nhighly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly\\nthe gentleman.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” replied Elinor, “I believe that you will find him, on farther\\nacquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be\\nsuch very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost\\nclose to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he\\n_should_ be all this.”\\n\\nEdward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her\\na look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he\\nmight hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the\\nmansion-house much greater.\\n\\n“Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,” said he, soon\\nafterwards, rising from his chair.\\n\\nElinor told him the number of the house.\\n\\n“I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not\\nallow me to give _you;_ to assure him that he has made me a very—an\\nexceedingly happy man.”\\n\\nElinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very\\nearnest assurance on _her_ side of her unceasing good wishes for his\\nhappiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on _his_,\\nwith rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of\\nexpressing it.\\n\\n“When I see him again,” said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him\\nout, “I shall see him the husband of Lucy.”\\n\\nAnd with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the\\npast, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of\\nEdward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people\\nwhom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a\\ngreat deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important\\nsecret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to\\nit again as soon as Elinor appeared.\\n\\n“Well, my dear,” she cried, “I sent you up the young man. Did not I do\\nright?—And I suppose you had no great difficulty—You did not find him\\nvery unwilling to accept your proposal?”\\n\\n“No, ma’am; _that_ was not very likely.”\\n\\n“Well, and how soon will he be ready?—For it seems all to depend upon\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Really,” said Elinor, “I know so little of these kind of forms, that I\\ncan hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation\\nnecessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his\\nordination.”\\n\\n“Two or three months!” cried Mrs. Jennings; “Lord! my dear, how calmly\\nyou talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord\\nbless me!—I am sure it would put _me_ quite out of patience!—And though\\none would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think\\nit is not worth while to wait two or three months for him. Sure\\nsomebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in\\norders already.”\\n\\n“My dear ma’am,” said Elinor, “what can you be thinking of? Why,\\nColonel Brandon’s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.”\\n\\n“Lord bless you, my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the\\nColonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.\\nFerrars!”\\n\\nThe deception could not continue after this; and an explanation\\nimmediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for\\nthe moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.\\nJennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still\\nwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first.\\n\\n“Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,” said she, after the first\\nebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, “and very likely\\n_may_ be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought,\\nfor a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the\\nground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen\\nbeds! and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage! It\\nseems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to\\ndo some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them,\\nbefore Lucy goes to it.”\\n\\n“But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living’s\\nbeing enough to allow them to marry.”\\n\\n“The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year\\nhimself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word for\\nit, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford\\nParsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan’t go if Lucy an’t\\nthere.”\\n\\nElinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not\\nwaiting for any thing more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\n\\nEdward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with\\nhis happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he\\nreached Bartlett’s Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.\\nJennings, who called on her again the next day with her\\ncongratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in\\nher life.\\n\\nHer own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and\\nshe joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their\\nbeing all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.\\nSo far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor\\nthat credit which Edward _would_ give her, that she spoke of her\\nfriendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to\\nown all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion\\nfor their good on Miss Dashwood’s part, either present or future, would\\never surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in\\nthe world for those she really valued. As for Colonel Brandon, she was\\nnot only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly\\nanxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;\\nanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and secretly\\nresolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,\\nof his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.\\n\\nIt was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley\\nStreet, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his\\nwife’s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel\\nit necessary to pay her a visit.—This was an obligation, however, which\\nnot only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the assistance\\nof any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, not contented with\\nabsolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to prevent her\\nsister’s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her carriage was\\nalways at Elinor’s service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood,\\nthat not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late\\ndiscovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward’s\\npart, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again. The\\nconsequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit, for\\nwhich no one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of\\na tête-à-tête with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much\\nreason to dislike.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the\\nhouse, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure\\nin meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in\\nBerkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see\\nher, invited her to come in.\\n\\nThey walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.—Nobody was there.\\n\\n“Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,” said he: “I will go to her\\npresently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the\\nworld to seeing _you_. Very far from it, indeed. _Now_ especially there\\ncannot be—but however, you and Marianne were always great favourites.\\nWhy would not Marianne come?”\\n\\nElinor made what excuse she could for her.\\n\\n“I am not sorry to see you alone,” he replied, “for I have a good deal\\nto say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon’s—can it be true?—has he\\nreally given it to Edward?—I heard it yesterday by chance, and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.”\\n\\n“It is perfectly true.—Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford\\nto Edward.”\\n\\n“Really!—Well, this is very astonishing!—no relationship!—no connection\\nbetween them!—and now that livings fetch such a price!—what was the\\nvalue of this?”\\n\\n“About two hundred a year.”\\n\\n“Very well—and for the next presentation to a living of that\\nvalue—supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and\\nlikely to vacate it soon—he might have got I dare say—fourteen hundred\\npounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before this\\nperson’s death? _Now_, indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a\\nman of Colonel Brandon’s sense! I wonder he should be so improvident in\\na point of such common, such natural, concern! Well, I am convinced\\nthat there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human\\ncharacter. I suppose, however—on recollection—that the case may\\nprobably be _this_. Edward is only to hold the living till the person\\nto whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to\\ntake it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.”\\n\\nElinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that\\nshe had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel\\nBrandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which\\nit was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.\\n\\n“It is truly astonishing!”—he cried, after hearing what she said—“what\\ncould be the Colonel’s motive?”\\n\\n“A very simple one—to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.”\\n\\n“Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky\\nman.—You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I\\nhave broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,—she will not like\\nto hear it much talked of.”\\n\\nElinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she\\nthought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth\\nto her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly\\nimpoverished.\\n\\n“Mrs. Ferrars,” added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so\\nimportant a subject, “knows nothing about it at present, and I believe\\nit will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may\\nbe. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.”\\n\\n“But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be\\nsupposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in\\nknowing that her son has money enough to live upon, for _that_ must be\\nquite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\\nsupposed to feel at all? She has done with her son,—she cast him off\\nfor ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\\nhim off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable\\nto any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account: she cannot be\\ninterested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be so weak as\\nto throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a\\nparent!”\\n\\n“Ah! Elinor,” said John, “your reasoning is very good, but it is\\nfounded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward’s unhappy match takes\\nplace, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never\\ndiscarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate\\nthat dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.\\nMrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.”\\n\\n“You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory\\nby _this_ time.”\\n\\n“You wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most\\naffectionate mothers in the world.”\\n\\nElinor was silent.\\n\\n“We think _now_,”—said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, “of\\n_Robert’s_ marrying Miss Morton.”\\n\\nElinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother’s\\ntone, calmly replied,—\\n\\n“The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.”\\n\\n“Choice!—how do you mean?”\\n\\n“I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be\\nthe same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.”\\n\\n“Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all\\nintents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any\\nthing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that\\none is superior to the other.”\\n\\nElinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.—His\\nreflections ended thus.\\n\\n“Of _one_ thing, my dear sister,” kindly taking her hand, and speaking\\nin an awful whisper, “I may assure you;—and I _will_ do it, because I\\nknow it must gratify you. I have good reason to think—indeed I have it\\nfrom the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it\\nwould be very wrong to say any thing about it,—but I have it from the\\nvery best authority,—not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say\\nit herself—but her daughter _did_, and I have it from her,—that in\\nshort, whatever objections there might be against a certain—a certain\\nconnection, you understand me,—it would have been far preferable to\\nher,—it would not have given her half the vexation that _this_ does. I\\nwas exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that\\nlight; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. ‘It would\\nhave been beyond comparison,’ she said, ‘the least evil of the two, and\\nshe would be glad to compound _now_ for nothing worse.’ But however,\\nall that is quite out of the question,—not to be thought of or\\nmentioned—as to any attachment you know, it never could be: all that is\\ngone by. But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew\\nhow much it must please you. Not that you have any reason to regret, my\\ndear Elinor. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well,—quite as\\nwell, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon\\nbeen with you lately?”\\n\\nElinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her\\nself-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;—and she was\\ntherefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply\\nherself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her\\nbrother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments’\\nchat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her\\nsister’s being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was\\nleft to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay\\nunconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so\\nunfair a division of his mother’s love and liberality, to the prejudice\\nof his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of\\nlife, and that brother’s integrity, was confirming her most\\nunfavourable opinion of his head and heart.\\n\\nThey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to\\nspeak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very\\ninquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as\\nshe had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very\\ndifferent, was not less striking than it had been on _him_. He laughed\\nmost immoderately. The idea of Edward’s being a clergyman, and living\\nin a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;—and when to\\nthat was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a\\nwhite surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith\\nand Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\\n\\nElinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the\\nconclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed\\non him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a\\nlook, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,\\nand gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\\nnot by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.\\n\\n“We may treat it as a joke,” said he, at last, recovering from the\\naffected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety\\nof the moment; “but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. Poor\\nEdward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it; for I know\\nhim to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow\\nperhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood,\\nfrom _your_ slight acquaintance. Poor Edward! His manners are certainly\\nnot the happiest in nature. But we are not all born, you know, with the\\nsame powers,—the same address. Poor fellow! to see him in a circle of\\nstrangers! To be sure it was pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I\\nbelieve he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and\\nprotest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst\\nforth. I could not believe it. My mother was the first person who told\\nme of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,\\nimmediately said to her, ‘My dear madam, I do not know what you may\\nintend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if\\nEdward does marry this young woman, _I_ never will see him again.’ That\\nwas what I said immediately. I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!\\nPoor Edward! he has done for himself completely,—shut himself out for\\never from all decent society! But, as I directly said to my mother, I\\nam not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education, it\\nwas always to be expected. My poor mother was half frantic.”\\n\\n“Have you ever seen the lady?”\\n\\n“Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in\\nfor ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward\\ncountry girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I\\nremember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely\\nto captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother\\nrelated the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from\\nthe match; but it was too late _then_, I found, to do any thing, for\\nunluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till\\nafter the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to\\ninterfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think\\nit is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly\\nshould have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. ‘My dear\\nfellow,’ I should have said, ‘consider what you are doing. You are\\nmaking a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family are\\nunanimous in disapproving.’ I cannot help thinking, in short, that\\nmeans might have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be\\nstarved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved.”\\n\\nHe had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance\\nof Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though _she_ never\\nspoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on\\nher mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she\\nentered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself. She\\neven proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her\\nsister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of\\nthem;—an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the room,\\nand hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every thing\\nthat was most affectionate and graceful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\n\\nOne other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her\\nbrother’s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton\\nwithout any expense, and on Colonel Brandon’s being to follow them to\\nCleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and\\nsisters in town;—and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland\\nwhenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was\\nthe most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,\\nassurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should\\ncome to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the\\ncountry.\\n\\nIt amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send\\nher to Delaford;—a place, in which, of all others, she would now least\\nchuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as\\nher future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when\\nthey parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.\\n\\nVery early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties\\nfrom Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective\\nhomes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. For the convenience of\\nCharlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their\\njourney, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel\\nBrandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.\\n\\nMarianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as\\nshe had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid\\nadieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those\\nhopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished\\nfor ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the place in which\\nWilloughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which\\n_she_ could have no share, without shedding many tears.\\n\\nElinor’s satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive. She\\nhad no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no\\ncreature behind, from whom it would give her a moment’s regret to be\\ndivided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the\\npersecution of Lucy’s friendship, she was grateful for bringing her\\nsister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked\\nforward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might\\ndo towards restoring Marianne’s peace of mind, and confirming her own.\\n\\nTheir journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into\\nthe cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was\\nit dwelt on by turns in Marianne’s imagination; and in the forenoon of\\nthe third they drove up to Cleveland.\\n\\nCleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping\\nlawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably\\nextensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance,\\nit had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth\\ngravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was\\ndotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of\\nthe fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them\\naltogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the\\noffices.\\n\\nMarianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the\\nconsciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty\\nfrom Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its\\nwalls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child\\nto the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the\\nwinding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a\\ndistant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering\\nover a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on\\nthe farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their\\nsummits Combe Magna might be seen.\\n\\nIn such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears\\nof agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit\\nto the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of\\nwandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she\\nresolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained\\nwith the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.\\n\\nShe returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,\\non an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of\\nthe morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen\\ngarden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the\\ngardener’s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the\\ngreen-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,\\nand nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of\\nCharlotte,—and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed\\nhopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being stolen\\nby a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood, she\\nfound fresh sources of merriment.\\n\\nThe morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment\\nabroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay\\nat Cleveland. With great surprise therefore, did she find herself\\nprevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had\\ndepended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over\\nthe grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred\\nher from it; but a heavy and settled rain even _she_ could not fancy\\ndry or pleasant weather for walking.\\n\\nTheir party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Palmer\\nhad her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the\\nfriends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton’s engagements,\\nand wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther\\nthan Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it, joined\\nin their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding her way\\nin every house to the library, however it might be avoided by the\\nfamily in general, soon procured herself a book.\\n\\nNothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer’s side that constant and friendly\\ngood humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The\\nopenness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of\\nrecollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms\\nof politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was\\nengaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was\\nnot conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her\\nlaugh.\\n\\nThe two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording\\na pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to\\ntheir conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had\\nreduced very low.\\n\\nElinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so\\nmuch variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she knew\\nnot what to expect to find him in his own family. She found him,\\nhowever, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,\\nand only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him\\nvery capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from\\nbeing so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much\\nsuperior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.\\nJennings and Charlotte. For the rest of his character and habits, they\\nwere marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all\\nunusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating,\\nuncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight\\nit; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been\\ndevoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the whole, much\\nbetter than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she\\ncould like him no more;—not sorry to be driven by the observation of\\nhis Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with\\ncomplacency on the remembrance of Edward’s generous temper, simple\\ntaste, and diffident feelings.\\n\\nOf Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received\\nintelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire\\nlately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of\\nMr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a great\\ndeal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies, and told\\nher what he meant to do himself towards removing them.—His behaviour to\\nher in this, as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in\\nmeeting her after an absence of only ten days, his readiness to\\nconverse with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well\\njustify Mrs. Jennings’s persuasion of his attachment, and would have\\nbeen enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first, believed\\nMarianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself. But as it\\nwas, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs.\\nJennings’s suggestion; and she could not help believing herself the\\nnicest observer of the two;—she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings\\nthought only of his behaviour;—and while his looks of anxious\\nsolicitude on Marianne’s feeling, in her head and throat, the beginning\\nof a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words, entirely escaped the\\nlatter lady’s observation;—_she_ could discover in them the quick\\nfeelings, and needless alarm of a lover.\\n\\nTwo delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her\\nbeing there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all\\nover the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,\\nwhere there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the\\ntrees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,\\nhad—assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet\\nshoes and stockings—given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a\\nday or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing\\nailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.\\nPrescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all\\ndeclined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a\\ncough, and a sore throat, a good night’s rest was to cure her entirely;\\nand it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went\\nto bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\n\\n\\nMarianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry\\nreplied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging\\nin her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting shivering\\nover the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or\\nin lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of\\nher amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more\\nindisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister’s\\ncomposure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against\\nMarianne’s inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night,\\ntrusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and\\nfelt no real alarm.\\n\\nA very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the\\nexpectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,\\nconfessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her\\nbed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings’s advice, of sending\\nfor the Palmers’ apothecary.\\n\\nHe came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to\\nexpect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, by\\npronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the\\nword “infection” to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,\\non her baby’s account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the\\nfirst to think Marianne’s complaint more serious than Elinor, now\\nlooked very grave on Mr. Harris’s report, and confirming Charlotte’s\\nfears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with\\nher infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as\\nidle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be\\nwithstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour\\nafter Mr. Harris’s arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his\\nnurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer’s, who lived a\\nfew miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at\\nher earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was\\nalmost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her. Mrs. Jennings,\\nhowever, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,\\ndeclared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as\\nMarianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care,\\nto supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and\\nElinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,\\ndesirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better\\nexperience in nursing, of material use.\\n\\nPoor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and\\nfeeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow\\nwould find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have\\nproduced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for\\non that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended\\nthe whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their\\nmother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was\\nall in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to\\nraise her spirits, and make her believe, as she _then_ really believed\\nherself, that it would be a very short one.\\n\\nThe next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the\\npatient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no\\namendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;\\nfor Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity\\nand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away\\nby his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his\\npromise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel\\nBrandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going\\nlikewise.—Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most\\nacceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much\\nuneasiness on her sister’s account, would be to deprive them both, she\\nthought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his\\nstay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to\\nplay at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her\\nsister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was\\ngratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not\\nlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings’s entreaty was\\nwarmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,\\nin leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss\\nDashwood in any emergence.\\n\\nMarianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.\\nShe knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of\\nCleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It\\ngave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it\\ngave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.\\n\\nTwo days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer’s departure, and her\\nsituation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who\\nattended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and\\nMiss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in\\nthe seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon,\\nwho was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings’s forebodings, was\\nnot in a state of mind to resist their influence. He tried to reason\\nhimself out of fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary\\nseemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day in which he was\\nleft entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission of every\\nmelancholy idea, and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion\\nthat he should see Marianne no more.\\n\\nOn the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of\\nboth were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared\\nhis patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every\\nsymptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed\\nin every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\\nletters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her\\nfriend’s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them\\nat Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able\\nto travel.\\n\\nBut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the\\nevening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and\\nuncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was\\nwilling to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of\\nhaving sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the\\ncordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a\\nslumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her\\nsleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a\\nconsiderable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she\\nresolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing\\nnothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her\\nmaid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in\\nthe housekeeper’s room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.\\n\\nThe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her\\nsister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of\\nposture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint\\nwhich passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful\\na slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in\\nthe house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,—\\n\\n“Is mama coming?”\\n\\n“Not yet,” cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting\\nMarianne to lie down again, “but she will be here, I hope, before it is\\nlong. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.”\\n\\n“But she must not go round by London,” cried Marianne, in the same\\nhurried manner. “I shall never see her, if she goes by London.”\\n\\nElinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while\\nattempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and\\nquicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her\\nalarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly\\nfor Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.\\nTo consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\\nlatter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\\nperformance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by\\nher sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he\\nwas generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.\\n\\nIt was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were\\nimmediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to\\nattempt the removal of:—he listened to them in silent despondence;—but\\nher difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that\\nseemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind,\\nhe offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.\\nElinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked him\\nwith brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off\\nhis servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses\\ndirectly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.\\n\\nThe comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon—or such\\na companion for her mother,—how gratefully was it felt!—a companion\\nwhose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose\\nfriendship might soothe her!—as far as the shock of such a summons\\n_could_ be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,\\nwould lessen it.\\n\\n_He_, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of\\na collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost\\ndespatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might\\nlook for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The\\nhorses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon\\nonly pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken\\ntoo low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. It was then about\\ntwelve o’clock, and she returned to her sister’s apartment to wait for\\nthe arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the\\nnight. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour after\\nhour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne’s side, and\\nin the most cruel anxiety on Elinor’s, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her\\napprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former\\nsecurity; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow\\nMrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what\\nher mistress had always thought.\\n\\nMarianne’s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\\nmother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\\nheart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\\nso many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\\nfancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\\nbeen delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\\narriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\\n\\nShe was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he_ could\\nnot come, for some other advice, when the former—but not till after\\nfive o’clock—arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends for\\nhis delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\\nalteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to be\\nmaterial, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must\\nprocure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated\\nto Elinor. He promised to call again in the course of three or four\\nhours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\\ncomposed than he had found them.\\n\\nWith strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\\ntheir aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\\nHer former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no\\ndoubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her\\nconviction of her sister’s danger would not allow her to offer the\\ncomfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the\\nearly death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck\\na less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings’s compassion\\nshe had other claims. She had been for three months her companion, was\\nstill under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,\\nand long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a\\nfavourite, was before her;—and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\\nconsidered that Marianne might probably be to _her_ what Charlotte was\\nto herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was very sincere.\\n\\nMr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;—but he came to be\\ndisappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His medicines\\nhad failed;—the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet—not\\nmore herself—remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more\\nthan all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice.\\nBut he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some\\nmore fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the\\nlast, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\\nthe ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm,\\nexcept when she thought of her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and\\nin this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her\\nsister’s bed, her thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one\\nsuffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by\\nthe conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the\\nseverity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous\\nindisposition which Marianne’s disappointment had brought on. Elinor\\nfelt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to\\nher reflections.\\n\\nAbout noon, however, she began—but with a caution—a dread of\\ndisappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\\nfriend—to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\\nsister’s pulse;—she waited, watched, and examined it again and\\nagain;—and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under\\nexterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to\\ncommunicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to\\nacknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from\\nindulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor, conning over every\\ninjunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was\\ntoo late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious\\nflutter, she bent over her sister to watch—she hardly knew for what.\\nHalf an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.\\nOthers even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all\\nflattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes\\non her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now\\noppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity\\ntill the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o’clock;—when his assurances,\\nhis felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\\nexpectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\\n\\nMarianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\\nentirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\\npartial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\\nlate alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\\nwith unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\\nprobability of an entire recovery.\\n\\nElinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led\\nto any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,\\nfriends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\\nsensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\\ngratitude;—but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no\\nsmiles. All within Elinor’s breast was satisfaction, silent and strong.\\n\\nShe continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\\nwhole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\\nenfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\\nlook and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course, in\\nsome moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was—but when she saw,\\non her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of recovery\\ncontinued, and saw Marianne at six o’clock sink into a quiet, steady,\\nand to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.\\n\\nThe time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected\\nback. At ten o’clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her\\nmother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must\\nnow be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!—perhaps scarcely less\\nan object of pity!—Oh!—how slow was the progress of time which yet kept\\nthem in ignorance!\\n\\nAt seven o’clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\\nMrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been\\nkept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\\nmuch;—and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\\ncontent as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings\\nwould have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\\nher mother’s arrival, and allow _her_ to take her place by Marianne;\\nbut Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that\\nmoment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\\nunnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\\ninto the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\\nleft her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her\\nown room to write letters and sleep.\\n\\nThe night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and the\\nrain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\\nregarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the\\ntravellers—they had a rich reward in store, for every present\\ninconvenience.\\n\\nThe clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\\nconvinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\\nhouse; and so strong was the persuasion that she _did_, in spite of the\\n_almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into\\nthe adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\\nsatisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not\\ndeceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.\\nBy their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn\\nby four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor mother’s\\nalarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.\\n\\nNever in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\\nthat moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the\\ncarriage stopt at the door—of her doubt—her dread—perhaps her\\ndespair!—and of what _she_ had to tell!—with such knowledge it was\\nimpossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\\nand, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings’s maid\\nwith her sister, she hurried down stairs.\\n\\nThe bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\\nassured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the\\ndrawing-room,—she entered it,—and saw only Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\n\\n\\nElinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed\\nthe first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,\\nand her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by\\nhis hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than\\nsupplication,\\n\\n“Miss Dashwood, for half an hour—for ten minutes—I entreat you to\\nstay.”\\n\\n“No, sir,” she replied with firmness, “I shall _not_ stay. Your\\nbusiness cannot be with _me_. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell\\nyou that Mr. Palmer was not in the house.”\\n\\n“Had they told me,” he cried with vehemence, “that Mr. Palmer and all\\nhis relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the\\ndoor. My business is with you, and only you.”\\n\\n“With me!”—in the utmost amazement—“well, sir,—be quick—and if you\\ncan—less violent.”\\n\\n“Sit down, and I will be both.”\\n\\nShe hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel\\nBrandon’s arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had\\npromised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was\\nengaged. After a moment’s recollection, therefore, concluding that\\nprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best\\npromote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He\\ntook the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by\\neither.\\n\\n“Pray be quick, sir,”—said Elinor, impatiently;—“I have no time to\\nspare.”\\n\\nHe was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to\\nhear her.\\n\\n“Your sister,” said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards—“is out of\\ndanger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!—But is it true? is\\nit really true?”\\n\\nElinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater\\neagerness.\\n\\n“For God’s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?”\\n\\n“We hope she is.”\\n\\nHe rose up, and walked across the room.\\n\\n“Had I known as much half an hour ago;—but since I _am_ here,” speaking\\nwith a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat,—“what does it\\nsignify? For once, Miss Dashwood—it will be the last time, perhaps—let\\nus be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood for gaiety. Tell me\\nhonestly” a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks, “do you think me most\\na knave or a fool?”\\n\\nElinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to\\nthink that he must be in liquor;—the strangeness of such a visit, and\\nof such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this\\nimpression she immediately rose, saying,\\n\\n“Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe. I am not\\nat leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be\\nwith me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.”\\n\\n“I understand you,” he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice\\nperfectly calm; “yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold\\nbeef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.”\\n\\n“At Marlborough!”—cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand\\nwhat he would be at.\\n\\n“Yes,—I left London this morning at eight o’clock, and the only ten\\nminutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a\\nnuncheon at Marlborough.”\\n\\nThe steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he\\nspoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might\\nbring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she\\nsaid, after a moment’s recollection,\\n\\n“Mr. Willoughby, you _ought_ to feel, and I certainly _do_, that after\\nwhat has passed, your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself\\nupon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that you\\nmean by it?”\\n\\n“I mean,” said he, with serious energy, “if I can, to make you hate me\\none degree less than you do _now_. I mean to offer some kind of\\nexplanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart\\nto you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a\\nblockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like\\nforgiveness from Ma— from your sister.”\\n\\n“Is this the real reason of your coming?”\\n\\n“Upon my soul it is,”—was his answer, with a warmth which brought all\\nthe former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made\\nher think him sincere.\\n\\n“If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne _does_, she\\nhas _long_ forgiven you.”\\n\\n“Has she?” he cried, in the same eager tone. “Then she has forgiven me\\nbefore she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and\\non more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?”\\n\\nElinor bowed her assent.\\n\\n“I do not know,” said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and\\nthoughtfulness on his own, “how _you_ may have accounted for my\\nbehaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have\\nimputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,—it is\\nworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first\\nbecame intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view\\nin the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged\\nto remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\\nYour sister’s lovely person and interesting manners could not but\\nplease me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a\\nkind—it is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she_\\nwas, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must\\nconfess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness,\\nthinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had\\nalways been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every\\nmeans in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design\\nof returning her affection.”\\n\\nMiss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most\\nangry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\\n\\n“It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me\\nto listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by\\nany thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the\\nsubject.”\\n\\n“I insist on you hearing the whole of it,” he replied, “My fortune was\\nnever large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of\\nassociating with people of better income than myself. Every year since\\nmy coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and\\nthough the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet\\nthat event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for\\nsome time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a\\nwoman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a\\nthing to be thought of; and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty,\\nwhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood,\\ncan ever reprobate too much,—I was acting in this manner, trying to\\nengage her regard, without a thought of returning it. But one thing may\\nbe said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not\\nknow the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not _then_\\nknow what it was to love. But have I ever known it? Well may it be\\ndoubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings\\nto vanity, to avarice? or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?\\nBut I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection\\nand her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by\\nraising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a\\nblessing.”\\n\\n“You did then,” said Elinor, a little softened, “believe yourself at\\none time attached to her?”\\n\\n“To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!\\nIs there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself, by\\ninsensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my\\nlife were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly\\nhonourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however, when fully\\ndetermined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most\\nimproperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an\\nunwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were\\nso greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here—nor will I stop for\\n_you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of\\nscrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The\\nevent has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great\\ncircumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible\\nand wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I\\nhad determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the\\nattentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an\\naffection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the\\ninterim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before\\nI could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private—a\\ncircumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my\\nresolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place,”—here\\nhe hesitated and looked down. “Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been\\ninformed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to\\ndeprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection—but I need not\\nexplain myself farther,” he added, looking at her with an heightened\\ncolour and an enquiring eye,—“your particular intimacy—you have\\nprobably heard the whole story long ago.”\\n\\n“I have,” returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart\\nanew against any compassion for him, “I have heard it all. And how you\\nwill explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I\\nconfess is beyond my comprehension.”\\n\\n“Remember,” cried Willoughby, “from whom you received the account.\\nCould it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her\\ncharacter ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify\\nmyself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have\\nnothing to urge—that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\\nand because _I_ was a libertine, _she_ must be a saint. If the violence\\nof her passions, the weakness of her understanding—I do not mean,\\nhowever, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better\\ntreatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness\\nwhich, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. I\\nwish—I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured more than\\nherself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me (may I say it?)\\nwas scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind—Oh! how infinitely\\nsuperior!”\\n\\n“Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl—I must say\\nit, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well\\nbe—your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do\\nnot think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of\\nunderstanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\\nYou must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in\\nDevonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was\\nreduced to the extremest indigence.”\\n\\n“But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,” he warmly replied; “I did not\\nrecollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense\\nmight have told her how to find it out.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?”\\n\\n“She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be\\nguessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her\\nignorance of the world—every thing was against me. The matter itself I\\ncould not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was\\npreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\\ngeneral, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\\nthe very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\\npresent visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I\\nmight have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she\\noffered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not\\nbe—and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The\\nnight following this affair—I was to go the next morning—was spent by\\nme in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle\\nwas great—but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough\\nconviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh\\nthat dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the\\nnecessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and\\nexpensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure\\nof my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself\\nto think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A\\nheavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;—I was\\nengaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore\\nnecessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write\\nthis apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To\\nsee Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I\\ncould see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however,\\nI undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I\\nsaw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable—and left her\\nhoping never to see her again.”\\n\\n“Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?” said Elinor, reproachfully; “a note\\nwould have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to call?”\\n\\n“It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the\\ncountry in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the\\nneighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between\\nMrs. Smith and myself—and I resolved therefore on calling at the\\ncottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,\\nwas really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.\\nYou were all gone I do not know where. I had left her only the evening\\nbefore, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A\\nfew hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how\\nhappy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to\\nAllenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in\\nthis, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense\\nof guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her sorrow,\\nher disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was obliged\\nto leave Devonshire so immediately—I never shall forget it—united too\\nwith such reliance, such confidence in me!—Oh, God!—what a hard-hearted\\nrascal I was!”\\n\\nThey were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.\\n\\n“Did you tell her that you should soon return?”\\n\\n“I do not know what I told her,” he replied, impatiently; “less than\\nwas due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more\\nthan was justified by the future. I cannot think of it.—It won’t\\ndo.—Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her\\nkindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it _did_ torture me. I was\\nmiserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\ngives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself\\nfor the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past\\nsufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I\\nwent, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was\\nonly indifferent. My journey to town—travelling with my own horses, and\\ntherefore so tediously—no creature to speak to—my own reflections so\\ncheerful—when I looked forward every thing so inviting!—when I looked\\nback at Barton, the picture so soothing!—oh, it was a blessed journey!”\\n\\nHe stopped.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for\\nhis departure, “and this is all?”\\n\\n“All!—no:—have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter?\\nDid she show it you?”\\n\\n“Yes, I saw every note that passed.”\\n\\n“When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in\\ntown the whole time,) what I felt is—in the common phrase, not to be\\nexpressed; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any\\nemotion—my feelings were very, very painful.—Every line, every word\\nwas—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,\\nwould forbid—a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town\\nwas—in the same language—a thunderbolt.—Thunderbolts and daggers!—what\\na reproof would she have given me!—her taste, her opinions—I believe\\nthey are better known to me than my own,—and I am sure they are\\ndearer.”\\n\\nElinor’s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this\\nextraordinary conversation, was now softened again;—yet she felt it her\\nduty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.\\n\\n“This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.—Remember that you are married.\\nRelate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to\\nhear.”\\n\\n“Marianne’s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in\\nformer days,—that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been\\nseparated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of\\nfaith in the constancy of mine as ever,—awakened all my remorse. I say\\nawakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in\\nsome measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened\\nvillain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that\\nshe too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our\\npast attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my\\nshoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,\\novercoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, ‘I shall be\\nheartily glad to hear she is well married.’ But this note made me know\\nmyself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any\\nother woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But\\nevery thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat\\nwas impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no\\nanswer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her\\nfarther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in\\nBerkeley Street;—but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a\\ncool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely\\nout of the house one morning, and left my name.”\\n\\n“Watched us out of the house!”\\n\\n“Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how\\noften I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a\\nshop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did in\\nBond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse\\nof one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness\\non my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your\\nsight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the Middletons as\\nmuch as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an\\nacquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town, however, I\\nblundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the\\nday after I had called at Mrs. Jennings’s. He asked me to a party, a\\ndance at his house in the evening. Had he _not_ told me as an\\ninducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have\\nfelt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The next morning\\nbrought another short note from Marianne—still affectionate, open,\\nartless, confiding—everything that could make _my_ conduct most\\nhateful. I could not answer it. I tried—but could not frame a sentence.\\nBut I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. If you _can_\\npity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was _then_. With my\\nhead and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy\\nlover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all.\\nWell, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what\\na sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne,\\nbeautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a\\ntone! Oh, God! holding out her hand to me, asking me for an\\nexplanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking\\nsolicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other\\nhand, looking all that was—Well, it does not signify; it is over now.\\nSuch an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not\\nbefore I had seen Marianne’s sweet face as white as death. _That_ was\\nthe last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she\\nappeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her to-day\\nas really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew\\nexactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world.\\nShe was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same\\nlook and hue.”\\n\\nA short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first\\nrousing himself, broke it thus:\\n\\n“Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better,\\ncertainly out of danger?”\\n\\n“We are assured of it.”\\n\\n“Your poor mother, too!—doting on Marianne.”\\n\\n“But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to\\nsay about that?”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, _that_ in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you\\nknow, the very next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting\\nat the Ellisons,—and her letter, with some others, was brought to me\\nthere from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia’s eye before it\\ncaught mine—and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing\\naltogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire,\\nand what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had\\nmarked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever.\\nAffecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a\\nwoman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents.\\nShe was well paid for her impudence. She read what made her wretched.\\nHer wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion—her malice—At all\\nevents it must be appeased. And, in short—what do you think of my\\nwife’s style of letter-writing?—delicate—tender—truly feminine—was it\\nnot?”\\n\\n“Your wife!—The letter was in your own hand-writing.”\\n\\n“Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as\\nI was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own—her own\\nhappy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do!—we were\\nengaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed—But I am\\ntalking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her money was\\nnecessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done\\nto prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my\\ncharacter in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language\\nmy answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My business\\nwas to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a\\nbluster was of little importance. ‘I am ruined for ever in their\\nopinion,’ said I to myself: ‘I am shut out for ever from their society,\\nthey already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will only\\nmake them think me a blackguard one.’ Such were my reasonings, as, in a\\nsort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife’s words, and parted\\nwith the last relics of Marianne. Her three notes,—unluckily they were\\nall in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and\\nhoarded them for ever,—I was forced to put them up, and could not even\\nkiss them. And the lock of hair—that too I had always carried about me\\nin the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most\\ningratiating virulence,—the dear lock,—all, every memento was torn from\\nme.”\\n\\n“You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,” said Elinor, while\\nher voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion;\\n“you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my\\nsister. You had made your own choice. It was not forced on you. Your\\nwife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least. She\\nmust be attached to you, or she would not have married you. To treat\\nher with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to\\nMarianne—nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.”\\n\\n“Do not talk to me of my wife,” said he with a heavy sigh; “she does\\nnot deserve your compassion. She knew I had no regard for her when we\\nmarried. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be\\nhappy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity\\nme, Miss Dashwood? Or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,—be it\\nonly one degree,—am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before? My\\nintentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any part of my\\nguilt?”\\n\\n“Yes, you have certainly removed something—a little. You have proved\\nyourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have\\nproved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly know—the\\nmisery that you have inflicted—I hardly know what could have made it\\nworse.”\\n\\n“Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been\\ntelling you?—Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as\\nin yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me be able\\nto fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present\\nfeelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more\\ngentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my\\npenitence—tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if\\nyou will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.”\\n\\n“I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be\\ncalled, your justification. But you have not explained to me the\\nparticular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her\\nillness.”\\n\\n“Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and\\nwhen he saw who I was, for the first time these two months, he spoke to\\nme. That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without\\nsurprise or resentment. Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid\\nsoul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,\\ncould not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to,\\nthough probably he did not think it _would_, vex me horridly. As\\nbluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne\\nDashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland—a letter that morning\\nreceived from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent—the\\nPalmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much shocked to be\\nable to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir\\nJohn. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his\\nill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the\\nhand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What\\nI felt on hearing that your sister was dying, and dying too, believing\\nme the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest\\nmoments—for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been\\nimputed? _One_ person I was sure would represent me as capable of\\nanything—What I felt was dreadful! My resolution was soon made, and at\\neight o’clock this morning I was in my carriage. Now you know all.”\\n\\nElinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the\\nirreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent\\nhabits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the\\ncharacter, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person\\nand talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a\\nfeeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant and\\nvain—Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.\\nVanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,\\nhad involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least\\nits offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faulty\\npropensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment.\\nThe attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against\\nevery better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no\\nlonger allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the\\nsake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery,\\nwas likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more\\nincurable nature. From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the\\nend of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie\\nat least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and\\nsaid—\\n\\n“There is no use in staying here; I must be off.”\\n\\n“Are you going back to town?”\\n\\n“No—to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a day\\nor two. Good bye.”\\n\\nHe held out his hand. She could not refuse to give him hers;—he pressed\\nit with affection.\\n\\n“And you _do_ think something better of me than you did?” said he,\\nletting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting\\nhe was to go.\\n\\nElinor assured him that she did;—that she forgave, pitied, wished him\\nwell—was even interested in his happiness—and added some gentle counsel\\nas to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was not very\\nencouraging.\\n\\n“As to that,” said he, “I must rub through the world as well as I can.\\nDomestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed to\\nthink that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it\\nmay be the means—it may put me on my guard—at least, it may be\\nsomething to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever. Were\\nI even by any blessed chance at liberty again—”\\n\\nElinor stopped him with a reproof.\\n\\n“Well,”—he replied—“once more good bye. I shall now go away and live in\\ndread of one event.”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Your sister’s marriage.”\\n\\n“You are very wrong. She can never be more lost to you than she is\\nnow.”\\n\\n“But she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should\\nbe the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear—but I will not\\nstay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by showing that\\nwhere I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,—God bless\\nyou!”\\n\\nAnd with these words, he almost ran out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\n\\n\\nElinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the\\nsound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a\\ncrowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness\\nwas the general result, to think even of her sister.\\n\\nWilloughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most\\nworthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a\\ndegree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made\\nher think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with a\\ntenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged\\nwithin herself—to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his\\ninfluence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not\\nin reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that\\nopen, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;\\nand by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even\\ninnocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long before she\\ncould feel his influence less.\\n\\nWhen at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her\\njust awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of\\nher hopes. Elinor’s heart was full. The past, the present, the future,\\nWilloughby’s visit, Marianne’s safety, and her mother’s expected\\narrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept\\noff every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of betraying\\nherself to her sister. Short was the time, however, in which that fear\\ncould affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby’s leaving\\nthe house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of another\\ncarriage.—Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment’s\\nhorrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the\\noutward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced\\nalmost the conviction of Marianne’s being no more, had no voice to\\ninquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but _she_, waiting neither\\nfor salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief; and her\\nmother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as much\\novercome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears. She was\\nsupported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;\\nand there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak,\\nembraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press\\nColonel Brandon’s hand, with a look which spoke at once her gratitude,\\nand her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the\\nmoment. He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.\\n\\nAs soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her\\nfirst desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,\\nrendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.\\nElinor’s delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only\\nchecked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep:\\nbut Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when the life\\nof a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing her mother\\nwas near her, and conscious of being too weak for conversation,\\nsubmitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse\\naround her. Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her all night; and\\nElinor, in compliance with her mother’s entreaty, went to bed. But the\\nrest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most\\nwearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of\\nspirits. Willoughby, “poor Willoughby,” as she now allowed herself to\\ncall him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would not but have heard\\nhis vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself\\nfor having judged him so harshly before. But her promise of relating it\\nto her sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of\\nit, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after\\nsuch an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a\\nmoment wished Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon,\\nreproved herself, felt that to _his_ sufferings and _his_ constancy far\\nmore than to his rival’s, the reward of her sister was due, and wished\\nany thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby’s death.\\n\\nThe shock of Colonel Brandon’s errand at Barton had been much softened\\nto Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her\\nuneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out\\nfor Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further\\nintelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,\\nthat the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,\\nas her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection.\\n\\nMarianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of\\nMrs. Dashwood’s looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly\\ndeclared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor could\\nnot hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes\\nwondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But Mrs.\\nDashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment\\nwhich Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to\\nthink only of what would increase it. Marianne was restored to her from\\na danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken judgment\\nin encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had\\ncontributed to place her;—and in her recovery she had yet another\\nsource of joy unthought of by Elinor. It was thus imparted to her, as\\nsoon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.\\n\\n“At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness.\\nColonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself.”\\n\\nHer daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and\\nnot surprised, was all silent attention.\\n\\n“You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your\\ncomposure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my\\nfamily, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon’s marrying one of you as\\nthe object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most\\nhappy with him of the two.”\\n\\nElinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because\\nsatisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,\\ncharacters, or feelings, could be given;—but her mother must always be\\ncarried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and\\ntherefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.\\n\\n“He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came out\\nquite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could talk\\nof nothing but my child;—he could not conceal his distress; I saw that\\nit equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as\\nthe world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy—or rather, not\\nthinking at all, I suppose—giving way to irresistible feelings, made me\\nacquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne.\\nHe has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing\\nher.”\\n\\nHere, however, Elinor perceived,—not the language, not the professions\\nof Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother’s\\nactive fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it\\nchose.\\n\\n“His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby\\never felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or\\nconstant—which ever we are to call it—has subsisted through all the\\nknowledge of dear Marianne’s unhappy prepossession for that worthless\\nyoung man!—and without selfishness—without encouraging a hope!—could he\\nhave seen her happy with another—Such a noble mind!—such openness, such\\nsincerity!—no one can be deceived in _him_.”\\n\\n“Colonel Brandon’s character,” said Elinor, “as an excellent man, is\\nwell established.”\\n\\n“I know it is,”—replied her mother seriously, “or after such a warning,\\n_I_ should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be\\npleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such\\nready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.”\\n\\n“His character, however,” answered Elinor, “does not rest on _one_ act\\nof kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of\\nthe case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons,\\nhe has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect\\nhim; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very\\nconsiderable; and so highly do _I_ value and esteem him, that if\\nMarianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to\\nthink our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What\\nanswer did you give him?—Did you allow him to hope?”\\n\\n“Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.\\nMarianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or\\nencouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible\\neffusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet\\nafter a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if\\nshe lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in\\npromoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful\\nsecurity, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every\\nencouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him, will\\ndo everything; Marianne’s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a\\nman as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it.”\\n\\n“To judge from the Colonel’s spirits, however, you have not yet made\\nhim equally sanguine.”\\n\\n“No. He thinks Marianne’s affection too deeply rooted for any change in\\nit under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again\\nfree, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a\\ndifference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There,\\nhowever, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers as\\nto be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed; and\\nhis disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make\\nyour sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are all in his\\nfavour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so\\nhandsome as Willoughby; but at the same time, there is something much\\nmore pleasing in his countenance. There was always a something, if you\\nremember, in Willoughby’s eyes at times, which I did not like.”\\n\\nElinor could _not_ remember it; but her mother, without waiting for her\\nassent, continued,\\n\\n“And his manners, the Colonel’s manners are not only more pleasing to\\nme than Willoughby’s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to\\nbe more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their genuine\\nattention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much\\nmore accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness, often\\nartificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am very sure myself,\\nthat had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved\\nhimself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with\\n_him_ as she will be with Colonel Brandon.”\\n\\nShe paused.—Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her\\ndissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.\\n\\n“At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,” added Mrs.\\nDashwood, “even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,—for I\\nhear it is a large village,—indeed there certainly _must_ be some small\\nhouse or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our\\npresent situation.”\\n\\nPoor Elinor!—here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!—but her\\nspirit was stubborn.\\n\\n“His fortune too!—for at my time of life you know, everybody cares\\nabout _that;_—and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it\\nreally is, I am sure it must be a good one.”\\n\\nHere they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and\\nElinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her\\nfriend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVI.\\n\\n\\nMarianne’s illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long\\nenough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and\\nher mother’s presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her\\nto remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.\\nPalmer’s dressing-room. When there, at her own particular request, for\\nshe was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her\\nmother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.\\n\\nHis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in\\nreceiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was\\nsuch, as, in Elinor’s conjecture, must arise from something more than\\nhis affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to\\nothers; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many\\npast scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance\\nbetween Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened\\nby the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but\\nwith a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very\\ndifferent effect, saw nothing in the Colonel’s behaviour but what arose\\nfrom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions\\nand words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something\\nmore than gratitude already dawned.\\n\\nAt the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger\\nevery twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her\\ndaughter’s wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On _her_\\nmeasures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not\\nquit Cleveland during the Dashwoods’ stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon\\nbrought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as\\nequally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs.\\nJennings’s united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to\\naccept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better\\naccommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint\\ninvitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature\\nmade her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,\\nengaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the\\ncourse of a few weeks.\\n\\nThe day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking\\nso particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly\\ngrateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own\\nheart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\\nColonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully\\nassisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she\\nshould engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,\\nand the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and\\nfeel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise\\nto take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young\\ncompanions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his\\nsolitary way to Delaford.\\n\\nThe Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey\\non both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous\\naffection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,\\nwas the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward\\nin her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To Elinor, the\\nobservation of the latter was particularly grateful. She, who had seen\\nher week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of\\nheart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to\\nconceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an\\napparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted\\nof serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and\\ncheerfulness.\\n\\nAs they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every\\nfield and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,\\nshe grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their\\nnotice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But here, Elinor could\\nneither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted Marianne\\nfrom the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an emotion\\ntoo natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in\\nits unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of her subsequent\\nmanner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable\\nexertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room,\\nthan Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute\\nfirmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of\\nevery object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be\\nconnected.—She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,\\nand though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without\\nthe atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte.\\nShe went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an\\nopera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\\nfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his\\nhand-writing.—That would not do.—She shook her head, put the music\\naside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of\\nfeebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring\\nhowever with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice\\nmuch.\\n\\nThe next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the\\ncontrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\\nand spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\\nMargaret’s return, and talking of the dear family party which would\\nthen be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the\\nonly happiness worth a wish.\\n\\n“When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,” said\\nshe, “we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the\\nfarm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will\\nwalk to Sir John’s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\\nand we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace\\nits foundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we\\nshall be happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never\\nto be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall\\ndivide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,\\nand am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own\\nlibrary is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond\\nmere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at the\\nPark; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can\\nborrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I shall\\ngain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which\\nI now feel myself to want.”\\n\\nElinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;\\nthough smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her\\nto the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work\\nin introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\\nvirtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared\\nshe had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\\nMarianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy\\ntranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved to\\nwait till her sister’s health were more secure, before she appointed\\nit. But the resolution was made only to be broken.\\n\\nMarianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was\\nfine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a\\nsoft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter’s\\nwishes and the mother’s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor’s\\narm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in\\nthe lane before the house.\\n\\nThe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an\\nexercise hitherto untried since her illness required; and they had\\nadvanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the\\nhill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned\\ntowards it, Marianne calmly said,—\\n\\n“There, exactly there,”—pointing with one hand, “on that projecting\\nmound,—there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.”\\n\\nHer voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\\n\\n“I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!\\nshall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?” hesitatingly it was said.\\n“Or will it be wrong? I _can_ talk of it now, I hope, as I ought to\\ndo.”\\n\\nElinor tenderly invited her to be open.\\n\\n“As for regret,” said Marianne, “I have done with that, as far as _he_\\nis concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have\\nbeen for him, but what they are _now_. At present, if I could be\\nsatisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not\\n_always_ acting a part, not _always_ deceiving me; but above all, if I\\ncould be assured that he never was so _very_ wicked as my fears have\\nsometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl—”\\n\\nShe stopt. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,\\n\\n“If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.”\\n\\n“Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it\\nhorrible to suspect a person, who has been what _he_ has been to _me_,\\nof such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a\\nsituation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could\\nexpose me to—”\\n\\n“How then,” asked her sister, “would you account for his behaviour?”\\n\\n“I would suppose him,—Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle,\\nvery, very fickle.”\\n\\nElinor said no more. She was debating within herself on the eligibility\\nof beginning her story directly, or postponing it till Marianne were in\\nstronger health;—and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.\\n\\n“I am not wishing him too much good,” said Marianne at last with a\\nsigh, “when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant\\nthan my own. He will suffer enough in them.”\\n\\n“Do you compare your conduct with his?”\\n\\n“No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with\\nyours.”\\n\\n“Our situations have borne little resemblance.”\\n\\n“They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\\nyour kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness\\nhas made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious\\nrecollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was\\nperfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own\\nbehaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last\\nautumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of\\nkindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my\\nsufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me\\nto the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by\\nmyself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the\\ntime to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I\\ndid not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such\\nfeelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,—wonder\\nthat the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for\\natonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I\\ndied, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my\\nfriend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my\\nlatter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I\\nhave lived in _your_ remembrance! My mother too! How could you have\\nconsoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I\\nlooked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing\\nindulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing\\nkindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To\\nthe Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common\\nacquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart\\nhardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very\\nattention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they\\ndeserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above\\nmy mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and\\nits sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion\\nthat could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me; but to\\nwhat avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I\\nimitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part\\nin those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which\\nyou had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew\\nyou to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn\\naway from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing\\nsorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had\\ndeserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an\\nunbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.”\\n\\nHere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,\\nimpatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly\\nthat praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well\\ndeserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied,—\\n\\n“You are very good.—The future must be my proof. I have laid down my\\nplan, and if I am capable of adhering to it—my feelings shall be\\ngoverned and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor\\ntorture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my mother,\\nand Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my\\naffections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I shall never\\nagain have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other\\nsociety, it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled, my heart\\namended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of\\nlife, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby—to say that I\\nshall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. His\\nremembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions.\\nBut it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,\\nby constant employment.”\\n\\nShe paused—and added in a low voice, “If I could but know _his_ heart,\\neverything would become easy.”\\n\\nElinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or\\nimpropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all\\nnearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as\\nreflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\\nleading to the fact.\\n\\nShe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her\\nanxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief\\npoints on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his\\nrepentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\\nMarianne said not a word.—She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\\nground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A\\nthousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge\\none. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister’s, and tears covered\\nher cheeks.\\n\\nElinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they\\nreached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity\\nmust be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing\\nbut Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully\\nminute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could\\nbe safely indulged. As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a\\nkiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her\\ntears, “Tell mama,” withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up\\nstairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as\\nwhat she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its\\nresult, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne\\nfail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting\\ninjunction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\n\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former\\nfavourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his\\nimputed guilt;—she was sorry for him;—she wished him happy. But the\\nfeelings of the past could not be recalled.—Nothing could restore him\\nwith a faith unbroken—a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing\\ncould do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his\\nmeans, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing could\\nreplace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the interests\\nof Colonel Brandon.\\n\\nHad Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby’s story from\\nhimself—had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence of\\nhis countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion\\nwould have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor’s power, nor in\\nher wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed\\nexplanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection\\nhad given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of\\nWilloughby’s deserts;—she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple\\ntruth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his character,\\nwithout any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray.\\n\\nIn the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began\\nvoluntarily to speak of him again;—but that it was not without an\\neffort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for\\nsome time previously sitting—her rising colour, as she spoke,—and her\\nunsteady voice, plainly showed.\\n\\n“I wish to assure you both,” said she, “that I see every thing—as you\\ncan desire me to do.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing\\ntenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister’s\\nunbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. Marianne\\nslowly continued,—\\n\\n“It is a great relief to me—what Elinor told me this morning—I have now\\nheard exactly what I wished to hear.”—For some moments her voice was\\nlost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness than\\nbefore—“I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I never\\ncould have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I\\nmust have known, all this.—I should have had no confidence, no esteem.\\nNothing could have done it away to my feelings.”\\n\\n“I know it—I know it,” cried her mother. “Happy with a man of libertine\\npractices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our\\nfriends, and the best of men!—No—my Marianne has not a heart to be made\\nhappy with such a man!—Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would\\nhave felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt.”\\n\\nMarianne sighed, and repeated, “I wish for no change.”\\n\\n“You consider the matter,” said Elinor, “exactly as a good mind and a\\nsound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as\\nwell as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,\\nreason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\\nin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have\\nbeen poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.\\nHad you married, you must have been always poor. His expensiveness is\\nacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that\\nself-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His demands and your\\ninexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought\\non distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous to you, from\\nhaving been entirely unknown and unthought of before. _Your_ sense of\\nhonour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your\\nsituation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you\\npossible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on\\nyour own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but\\nbeyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management\\ndo to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage? Beyond\\n_that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge _his_\\nenjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on\\nfeelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own\\ninfluence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had\\ninvolved him in such difficulties?”\\n\\nMarianne’s lips quivered, and she repeated the word “Selfish?” in a\\ntone that implied—“do you really think him selfish?”\\n\\n“The whole of his behaviour,” replied Elinor, “from the beginning to\\nthe end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was\\nselfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\\nafterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of\\nit, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment, or\\nhis own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.”\\n\\n“It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his object.”\\n\\n“At present,” continued Elinor, “he regrets what he has done. And why\\ndoes he regret it?—Because he finds it has not answered towards\\nhimself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now\\nunembarrassed—he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. But\\ndoes it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?—The\\ninconveniences would have been different. He would then have suffered\\nunder the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he now\\nreckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of whose temper he could\\nmake no complaint, but he would have been always necessitous—always\\npoor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable\\ncomforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,\\neven to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife.”\\n\\n“I have not a doubt of it,” said Marianne; “and I have nothing to\\nregret—nothing but my own folly.”\\n\\n“Rather say your mother’s imprudence, my child,” said Mrs. Dashwood;\\n“_she_ must be answerable.”\\n\\nMarianne would not let her proceed;—and Elinor, satisfied that each\\nfelt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might\\nweaken her sister’s spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first\\nsubject, immediately continued,\\n\\n“_One_ observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the\\nstory—that all Willoughby’s difficulties have arisen from the first\\noffence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime\\nhas been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present\\ndiscontents.”\\n\\nMarianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led\\nby it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon’s injuries and merits, warm\\nas friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not\\nlook, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\\n\\nElinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following\\ndays, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done;\\nbut while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear\\ncheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time\\nupon her health.\\n\\nMargaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each\\nother, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their\\nusual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to\\nBarton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\\n\\nElinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She had heard nothing\\nof him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans, nothing\\ncertain even of his present abode. Some letters had passed between her\\nand her brother, in consequence of Marianne’s illness; and in the first\\nof John’s, there had been this sentence:—“We know nothing of our\\nunfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a\\nsubject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford;” which was all the\\nintelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name\\nwas not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters. She was not\\ndoomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.\\n\\nTheir man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and\\nwhen, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his\\nmistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary\\ncommunication,—\\n\\n“I suppose you know, ma’am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.”\\n\\nMarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her\\nturning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,\\nwhose eyes, as she answered the servant’s inquiry, had intuitively\\ntaken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor’s\\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,\\nalike distressed by Marianne’s situation, knew not on which child to\\nbestow her principal attention.\\n\\nThe servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense\\nenough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood’s assistance,\\nsupported her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather\\nbetter, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the\\nmaid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far\\nrecovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an\\ninquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence. Mrs. Dashwood\\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the\\nbenefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.\\n\\n“Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?”\\n\\n“I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma’am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady\\ntoo, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of\\nthe New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the\\nPark to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up\\nas I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss\\nSteele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and\\ninquired after you, ma’am, and the young ladies, especially Miss\\nMarianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars’s,\\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not\\ntime to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go\\nforwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but\\nhowsever, when they come back, they’d make sure to come and see you.”\\n\\n“But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since\\nshe was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken\\nyoung lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy.”\\n\\n“Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look\\nup;—he never was a gentleman much for talking.”\\n\\nElinor’s heart could easily account for his not putting himself\\nforward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.\\n\\n“Was there no one else in the carriage?”\\n\\n“No, ma’am, only they two.”\\n\\n“Do you know where they came from?”\\n\\n“They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy—Mrs. Ferrars told me.”\\n\\n“And are they going farther westward?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am—but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and\\nthen they’d be sure and call here.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than\\nto expect them. She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and\\nwas very confident that Edward would never come near them. She observed\\nin a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going down to\\nMr. Pratt’s, near Plymouth.\\n\\nThomas’s intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she wished to\\nhear more.\\n\\n“Did you see them off, before you came away?”\\n\\n“No, ma’am—the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any\\nlonger; I was afraid of being late.”\\n\\n“Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was\\nalways a very handsome young lady—and she seemed vastly contented.”\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the\\ntablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.\\nMarianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.\\nMrs. Dashwood’s and Elinor’s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both\\nher sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often\\nhad to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go\\nwithout her dinner before.\\n\\nWhen the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and\\nElinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a\\nsimilarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to\\nhazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now found\\nthat she had erred in relying on Elinor’s representation of herself;\\nand justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at\\nthe time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as\\nshe then had suffered for Marianne. She found that she had been misled\\nby the careful, the considerate attention of her daughter, to think the\\nattachment, which once she had so well understood, much slighter in\\nreality, than she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved\\nto be. She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust,\\ninattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;—that Marianne’s\\naffliction, because more acknowledged, more immediately before her, had\\ntoo much engrossed her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in\\nElinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much, certainly\\nwith less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\\n\\n\\nElinor now found the difference between the expectation of an\\nunpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,\\nand certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she had\\nalways admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something\\nwould occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his\\nown, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of\\nestablishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.\\nBut he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking\\nflattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.\\n\\nThat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in\\norders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the\\nliving, surprised her a little at first. But she soon saw how likely it\\nwas that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him,\\nshould overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were married,\\nmarried in town, and now hastening down to her uncle’s. What had Edward\\nfelt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother’s\\nservant, on hearing Lucy’s message!\\n\\nThey would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.—Delaford,—that\\nplace in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which she\\nwished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid. She saw them in\\nan instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,\\ncontriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with\\nthe utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her\\neconomical practices;—pursuing her own interest in every thought,\\ncourting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every\\nwealthy friend. In Edward—she knew not what she saw, nor what she\\nwished to see;—happy or unhappy,—nothing pleased her; she turned away\\nher head from every sketch of him.\\n\\nElinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London\\nwould write to them to announce the event, and give farther\\nparticulars,—but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no\\ntidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault\\nwith every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.\\n\\n“When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma’am?” was an inquiry which\\nsprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.\\n\\n“I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to\\nhear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should\\nnot be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.”\\n\\nThis was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel\\nBrandon _must_ have some information to give.\\n\\nScarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on\\nhorseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopt at their gate. It was a\\ngentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear more; and\\nshe trembled in expectation of it. But it was _not_ Colonel Brandon;\\nneither his air, nor his height. Were it possible, she must say it must\\nbe Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted: she could not be\\nmistaken,—it _was_ Edward. She moved away and sat down. “He comes from\\nMr. Pratt’s purposely to see us. I _will_ be calm; I _will_ be mistress\\nof myself.”\\n\\nIn a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the\\nmistake. She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look\\nat herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She would have\\ngiven the world to be able to speak—and to make them understand that\\nshe hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to\\nhim;—but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their\\nown discretion.\\n\\nNot a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the\\nappearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along the gravel\\npath; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before\\nthem.\\n\\nHis countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\\nElinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if\\nfearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\\nMrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of\\nthat daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be\\nguided in every thing, met him with a look of forced complacency, gave\\nhim her hand, and wished him joy.\\n\\nHe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor’s lips\\nhad moved with her mother’s, and, when the moment of action was over,\\nshe wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too\\nlate, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and\\ntalked of the weather.\\n\\nMarianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her\\ndistress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of\\nthe case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore\\ntook a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict\\nsilence.\\n\\nWhen Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very\\nawful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt\\nobliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a hurried\\nmanner, he replied in the affirmative.\\n\\nAnother pause.\\n\\nElinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own\\nvoice, now said,\\n\\n“Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?”\\n\\n“At Longstaple!” he replied, with an air of surprise. “No, my mother is\\nin town.”\\n\\n“I meant,” said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, “to enquire\\nfor Mrs. _Edward_ Ferrars.”\\n\\nShe dared not look up;—but her mother and Marianne both turned their\\neyes on him. He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,\\nafter some hesitation, said,—\\n\\n“Perhaps you mean—my brother—you mean Mrs.—Mrs. _Robert_ Ferrars.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Robert Ferrars!” was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an\\naccent of the utmost amazement; and though Elinor could not speak, even\\n_her_ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He rose\\nfrom his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing\\nwhat to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and while\\nspoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as\\nhe spoke, said, in a hurried voice,—\\n\\n“Perhaps you do not know: you may not have heard that my brother is\\nlately married to—to the youngest—to Miss Lucy Steele.”\\n\\nHis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,\\nwho sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such\\nagitation as made her hardly know where she was.\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, “they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.”\\n\\nElinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as\\nsoon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first\\nshe thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any\\nwhere, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw—or even\\nheard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie,\\nwhich no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.\\nDashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted\\nthe room, and walked out towards the village—leaving the others in the\\ngreatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so\\nwonderful and so sudden;—a perplexity which they had no means of\\nlessening but by their own conjectures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX.\\n\\n\\nUnaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might\\nappear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to\\nwhat purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined\\nby all;—for after experiencing the blessings of _one_ imprudent\\nengagement, contracted without his mother’s consent, as he had already\\ndone for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in\\nthe failure of _that_, than the immediate contraction of another.\\n\\nHis errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask\\nElinor to marry him;—and considering that he was not altogether\\ninexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should\\nfeel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in\\nneed of encouragement and fresh air.\\n\\nHow soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how\\nsoon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he\\nexpressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly\\ntold. This only need be said;—that when they all sat down to table at\\nfour o’clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his\\nlady, engaged her mother’s consent, and was not only in the rapturous\\nprofession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\\nof the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly\\njoyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell\\nhis heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach\\nto himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from\\na woman whom he had long ceased to love;—and elevated at once to that\\nsecurity with another, which he must have thought of almost with\\ndespair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. He was\\nbrought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;—and\\nthe change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful\\ncheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him before.\\n\\nHis heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors\\nconfessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the\\nphilosophic dignity of twenty-four.\\n\\n“It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,” said he, “the\\nconsequence of ignorance of the world, and want of employment. Had my\\nmother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never\\nhave happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the\\ntime, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had\\nany pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\\nfrom her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied\\nattachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I\\nmust have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of\\nhaving any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any\\nmyself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first\\ntwelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which\\nbelonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered\\nat Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to\\ndo, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home\\nin every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my\\nbrother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to\\nbe very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and\\nwas always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part\\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything\\nthat was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too—at least I thought so\\n_then;_ and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no\\ncomparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I\\nhope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every\\nway been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable\\npiece of folly.”\\n\\nThe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness\\nof the Dashwoods, was such—so great—as promised them all, the\\nsatisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be\\ncomfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how\\nto be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,\\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation\\ntogether, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.\\n\\nMarianne could speak _her_ happiness only by tears. Comparisons would\\noccur—regrets would arise; and her joy, though sincere as her love for\\nher sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.\\n\\nBut Elinor—how are _her_ feelings to be described? From the moment of\\nlearning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the\\nmoment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she\\nwas every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the second moment had\\npassed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared\\nher situation with what so lately it had been,—saw him honourably\\nreleased from his former engagement,—saw him instantly profiting by the\\nrelease, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as\\nconstant as she had ever supposed it to be,—she was oppressed, she was\\novercome by her own felicity; and happily disposed as is the human mind\\nto be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it required\\nseveral hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree of\\ntranquillity to her heart.\\n\\nEdward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;—for whatever\\nother claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a\\nweek should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor’s company, or\\nsuffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and\\nthe future;—for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of\\nincessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in\\ncommon between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is\\ndifferent. Between _them_ no subject is finished, no communication is\\neven made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.\\n\\nLucy’s marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,\\nformed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;—and\\nElinor’s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in\\nevery view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable\\ncircumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together,\\nand by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of\\nwhose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,—a\\ngirl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that\\nbrother had been thrown off by his family—it was beyond her\\ncomprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful affair,\\nto her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her reason, her\\njudgment, it was completely a puzzle.\\n\\nEdward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,\\nat first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked\\non by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.\\nElinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his\\nopinion of what his own mediation in his brother’s affairs might have\\ndone, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.\\n\\n“_That_ was exactly like Robert,” was his immediate observation. “And\\n_that_,” he presently added, “might perhaps be in _his_ head when the\\nacquaintance between them first began. And Lucy perhaps at first might\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs\\nmight afterward arise.”\\n\\nHow long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally\\nat a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had\\nremained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means\\nof hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last\\nwere neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not the\\nsmallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for\\nwhat followed;—and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy\\nherself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between\\nthe wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He put the\\nletter into Elinor’s hands.\\n\\n“DEAR SIR,\\n    “Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have thought\\n    myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and have no doubt of\\n    being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with\\n    you; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another’s.\\n    Sincerely wish you happy in your choice, and it shall not be my\\n    fault if we are not always good friends, as our near relationship\\n    now makes proper. I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am\\n    sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices. Your\\n    brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could not live\\n    without one another, we are just returned from the altar, and are\\n    now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which place your dear\\n    brother has great curiosity to see, but thought I would first\\n    trouble you with these few lines, and shall always remain,\\n\\n\\n“Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\\n“LUCY FERRARS.\\n\\n\\n“I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture the first\\nopportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls—but the ring with my hair you\\nare very welcome to keep.”\\n\\nElinor read and returned it without any comment.\\n\\n“I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,” said Edward.—“For\\nworlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in former\\ndays.—In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!—how I have blushed\\nover the pages of her writing!—and I believe I may say that since the\\nfirst half year of our foolish—business—this is the only letter I ever\\nreceived from her, of which the substance made me any amends for the\\ndefect of the style.”\\n\\n“However it may have come about,” said Elinor, after a pause,—“they are\\ncertainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most\\nappropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert, through\\nresentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice;\\nand she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do\\nthe very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do. She\\nwill hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert’s marrying Lucy, than\\nshe would have been by your marrying her.”\\n\\n“She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.—She\\nwill be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him\\nmuch sooner.”\\n\\nIn what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew\\nnot, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted\\nby him. He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy’s\\nletter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest road\\nto Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with which\\nthat road did not hold the most intimate connection. He could do\\nnothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his\\nrapidity in seeking _that_ fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the\\njealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of\\nthe modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness\\nwith which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect\\na very cruel reception. It was his business, however, to say that he\\n_did_, and he said it very prettily. What he might say on the subject a\\ntwelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and\\nwives.\\n\\nThat Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of\\nmalice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to\\nElinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her\\ncharacter, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost\\nmeanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\\neven before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a\\nwant of liberality in some of her opinions—they had been equally\\nimputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter\\nreached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but such\\na persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement,\\nwhich, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother’s\\nanger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.\\n\\n“I thought it my duty,” said he, “independent of my feelings, to give\\nher the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was\\nrenounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in\\nthe world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there seemed\\nnothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how\\ncould I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing\\nmy fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most\\ndisinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I cannot\\ncomprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage it could\\nbe to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest\\nregard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world. She could\\nnot foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.”\\n\\n“No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;\\nthat your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost\\nnothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it\\nfettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was\\ncertainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration\\namong her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would\\nbe better for her to marry _you_ than be single.”\\n\\nEdward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have\\nbeen more natural than Lucy’s conduct, nor more self-evident than the\\nmotive of it.\\n\\nElinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which\\ncompliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at\\nNorland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.\\n\\n“Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,” said she; “because—to say\\nnothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to\\nfancy and expect _what_, as you were _then_ situated, could never be.”\\n\\nHe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken\\nconfidence in the force of his engagement.\\n\\n“I was simple enough to think, that because my _faith_ was plighted to\\nanother, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the\\nconsciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred\\nas my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only\\nfriendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and\\nLucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I _was_\\nwrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I\\nreconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than\\nthese:—The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but\\nmyself.”\\n\\nElinor smiled, and shook her head.\\n\\nEdward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon’s being expected at the\\nCottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,\\nbut to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\\nhis giving him the living of Delaford—“Which, at present,” said he,\\n“after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,\\nhe must think I have never forgiven him for offering.”\\n\\n_Now_ he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the\\nplace. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed\\nall his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the\\nparish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor\\nherself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it\\nwith so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.\\n\\nOne question after this only remained undecided, between them, one\\ndifficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by\\nmutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness\\ncertain—and they only wanted something to live upon. Edward had two\\nthousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all\\nthat they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.\\nDashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite\\nenough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year\\nwould supply them with the comforts of life.\\n\\nEdward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his\\nmother towards him; and on _that_ he rested for the residue of their\\nincome. But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would still\\nbe unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been spoken\\nof in Mrs. Ferrars’s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his\\nchusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert’s offence would serve no\\nother purpose than to enrich Fanny.\\n\\nAbout four days after Edward’s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to\\ncomplete Mrs. Dashwood’s satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of\\nhaving, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company\\nwith her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\\nnight to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\\nin the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers’ first tête-à-tête\\nbefore breakfast.\\n\\nA three weeks’ residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at\\nleast, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between\\nthirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne’s looks, all the kindness\\nof her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother’s language, to\\nmake it cheerful. Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\\ndid revive. No rumour of Lucy’s marriage had yet reached him:—he knew\\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were\\nconsequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was\\nexplained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice\\nin what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the\\ninterest of Elinor.\\n\\nIt would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good\\nopinion of each other, as they advanced in each other’s acquaintance,\\nfor it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles and\\ngood sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably have\\nbeen sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other\\nattraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters\\nfond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.\\n\\nThe letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\\nnerve in Elinor’s body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read\\nwith less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful\\ntale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour\\nforth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure, had\\nquite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all accounts,\\nalmost broken-hearted, at Oxford. “I do think,” she continued, “nothing\\nwas ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called\\nand sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul suspected anything of the\\nmatter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came crying to me the day\\nafter, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not\\nknowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her\\nmoney before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make\\na show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world; so I\\nwas very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter,\\nwhere she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in\\nhopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again. And I must say\\nthat Lucy’s crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is\\nworse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but\\nyou must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to comfort\\nhim.”\\n\\nMr. Dashwood’s strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars was the most\\nunfortunate of women—poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility—and\\nhe considered the existence of each, under such a blow, with grateful\\nwonder. Robert’s offence was unpardonable, but Lucy’s was infinitely\\nworse. Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars;\\nand even, if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son, his\\nwife should never be acknowledged as her daughter, nor be permitted to\\nappear in her presence. The secrecy with which everything had been\\ncarried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously\\nheightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the\\nothers, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage;\\nand he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy’s\\nengagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she\\nshould thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family. He\\nthus continued:—\\n\\n“Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward’s name, which does not\\nsurprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been\\nreceived from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent\\nby his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a\\nline to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper\\nsubmission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shown to\\nher mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of\\nMrs. Ferrars’s heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be\\non good terms with her children.”\\n\\nThis paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of\\nEdward. It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not\\nexactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\\n\\n“A letter of proper submission!” repeated he; “would they have me beg\\nmy mother’s pardon for Robert’s ingratitude to _her_, and breach of\\nhonour to _me?_ I can make no submission. I am grown neither humble nor\\npenitent by what has passed. I am grown very happy; but that would not\\ninterest. I know of no submission that _is_ proper for me to make.”\\n\\n“You may certainly ask to be forgiven,” said Elinor, “because you have\\noffended;—and I should think you might _now_ venture so far as to\\nprofess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew\\non you your mother’s anger.”\\n\\nHe agreed that he might.\\n\\n“And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be\\nconvenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent\\nin _her_ eyes as the first.”\\n\\nHe had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a\\nletter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,\\nas he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by\\nword of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing\\nto Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good\\noffices in his favour. “And if they really _do_ interest themselves,”\\nsaid Marianne, in her new character of candour, “in bringing about a\\nreconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely\\nwithout merit.”\\n\\nAfter a visit on Colonel Brandon’s side of only three or four days, the\\ntwo gentlemen quitted Barton together. They were to go immediately to\\nDelaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future\\nhome, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements\\nwere needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of\\nnights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L.\\n\\n\\nAfter a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent\\nand so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always\\nseemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward\\nwas admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\\n\\nHer family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of\\nher life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward\\na few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of\\nRobert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the\\nresuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\\n\\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\\nfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\\npresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\\nfeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off\\nas rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was\\nrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars\\nat first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss\\nDashwood, by every argument in her power;—told him, that in Miss Morton\\nhe would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;—and enforced\\nthe assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a\\nnobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the\\ndaughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three;_ but when she\\nfound that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation,\\nhe was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she judged it wisest,\\nfrom the experience of the past, to submit—and therefore, after such an\\nungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to\\nprevent every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree of consent\\nto the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\\n\\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to\\nbe considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now\\nher only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\\nobjection was made against Edward’s taking orders for the sake of two\\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\\nbeen given with Fanny.\\n\\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by\\nEdward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\\n\\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\\nchurch early in the autumn.\\n\\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the\\nMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the\\nParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could\\nchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. Mrs. Jennings’s\\nprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\\nshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\\nMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\\nbelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world. They had in fact\\nnothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,\\nand rather better pasturage for their cows.\\n\\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations\\nand friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was\\nalmost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the\\nexpense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\\n\\n“I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,” said John, as\\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\\nHouse, “_that_ would be saying too much, for certainly you have been\\none of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I\\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\\nbrother. His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent condition! And his woods,—I have not\\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\\nDelaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the\\nperson to attract him, yet I think it would altogether be advisable for\\nyou to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happen;\\nfor, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody\\nelse,—and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage,\\nand so forth. In short, you may as well give her a chance: you\\nunderstand me.”\\n\\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated them\\nwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by\\nher real favour and preference. _That_ was due to the folly of Robert,\\nand the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many\\nmonths had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had\\nat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of\\nhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous\\nattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was\\ngiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and\\nre-established him completely in her favour.\\n\\nThe whole of Lucy’s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance\\nof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however\\nits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and\\nconscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\\nvisited her in Bartlett’s Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\\nto him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\\nengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\\nthe matter. In that point, however, and that only, he erred; for though\\nLucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in\\n_time_, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\\nproduce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\\nthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour’s\\ndiscourse with himself. His attendance was by this means secured, and\\nthe rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came\\ngradually to talk only of Robert,—a subject on which he had always more\\nto say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an interest\\neven equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident to\\nboth, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his\\nconquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying\\nprivately without his mother’s consent. What immediately followed is\\nknown. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she\\nhad many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he drew several\\nplans for magnificent cottages;—and from thence returning to town,\\nprocured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of\\nasking it, which, at Lucy’s instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness,\\nat first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and\\nLucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have\\ntransgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But\\nperseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation\\nfor Robert’s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated\\nwith, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its\\ngraciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest\\nstate of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs.\\nFerrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never\\ncordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor,\\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an\\nintruder, _she_ was in every thing considered, and always openly\\nacknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town, received\\nvery liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms\\nimaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and\\nill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their\\nhusbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic\\ndisagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed\\nthe harmony in which they all lived together.\\n\\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to\\nit, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however,\\njustified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever\\nappeared in Robert’s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion\\nof his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving his\\nbrother too little, or bringing himself too much;—and if Edward might\\nbe judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular,\\nfrom an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and from the\\nregular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less\\ncontented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange.\\n\\nElinor’s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,\\nfor her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with\\nher. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure\\nin the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing\\nMarianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though\\nrather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now her\\ndarling object. Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she\\ndesired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her\\nvalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was\\nequally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his sorrows, and\\ntheir own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the\\nreward of all.\\n\\nWith such a confederacy against her—with a knowledge so intimate of his\\ngoodness—with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself, which at\\nlast, though long after it was observable to everybody else—burst on\\nher—what could she do?\\n\\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to\\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\\nconduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an\\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give\\nher hand to another!—and _that_ other, a man who had suffered no less\\nthan herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years\\nbefore, she had considered too old to be married,—and who still sought\\nthe constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\\n\\nBut so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with\\nexpecting,—instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and\\nfinding her only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in\\nher more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,—she found\\nherself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new\\nduties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the\\npatroness of a village.\\n\\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\\nbelieved he deserved to be;—in Marianne he was consoled for every past\\naffliction;—her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\\nand his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\\nhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\\neach observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves; and her\\nwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\\nonce been to Willoughby.\\n\\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\\nMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\\nthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\\nand rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own\\npunishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;—nor that he long thought\\nof Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he\\nwas for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an\\nhabitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be\\ndepended on—for he did neither. He lived to exert, and frequently to\\nenjoy himself. His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home\\nalways uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in\\nsporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic\\nfelicity.\\n\\nFor Marianne, however, in spite of his incivility in surviving her\\nloss, he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\\nperfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\\n\\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.\\nJennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an\\nage highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being\\nsupposed to have a lover.\\n\\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate; and among the\\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SENSE AND SENSIBILITY ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

The Horror in Clay._\\n\\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the\\nhuman mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island\\nof ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not\\nmeant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its\\nown direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing\\ntogether of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas\\nof reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either\\ngo mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace\\nand safety of a new dark age.\\n\\nTheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle\\nwherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have\\nhinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if\\nnot masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there\\ncame the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when I think\\nof it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread\\nglimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of\\nseparated things--in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of\\na dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing\\nout; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in\\nso hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep\\nsilent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his\\nnotes had not sudden death seized him.\\n\\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death\\nof my grand-uncle, George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic\\nlanguages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor\\nAngell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and\\nhad frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so\\nthat his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many.\\nLocally, interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of\\ndeath. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the\\nNewport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been\\njostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer\\ndark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from\\nthe waterfront to the deceased\\'s home in Williams Street. Physicians\\nwere unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed\\ndebate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk\\nascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for\\nthe end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but\\nlatterly I am inclined to wonder--and more than wonder.\\n\\nAs my granduncle\\'s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower,\\nI was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for\\nthat purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in\\nBoston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published\\nby the American Archeological Society, but there was one box which I\\nfound exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from showing\\nto other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not find the key till\\nit occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor\\ncarried always in his pocket. Then, indeed, I succeeded in opening it,\\nbut when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more\\nclosely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay\\nbas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I\\nfound? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most\\nsuperficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor\\nresponsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man\\'s peace of mind.\\n\\nThe bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about\\nfive by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs,\\nhowever, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for,\\nalthough the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do\\nnot often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric\\nwriting. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed\\ncertainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the\\npapers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this\\nparticular species, or even hint at its remotest affiliations.\\n\\nAbove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial\\nintent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear\\nidea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol\\nrepresenting a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could\\nconceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded\\nsimultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature,\\nI shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy,\\ntentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary\\nwings; but it was the _general outline_ of the whole which made it most\\nshockingly frightful. Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a\\nCyclopean architectural background.\\n\\nThe writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of\\npress cuttings, in Professor Angell\\'s most recent hand; and made no\\npretense to literary style. What seemed to be the main document was\\nheaded \"_CTHULHU CULT_\" in characters painstakingly printed to avoid\\nthe erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was\\ndivided into two sections, the first of which was headed \"1925--Dream\\nand Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R. I.,\" and\\nthe second, \"Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville\\nSt., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A. A. S. Mtg--Notes on Same, & Prof.\\nWebb\\'s Acct.\" The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some\\nof them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of\\nthem citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W.\\nScott-Eliott\\'s _Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria_), and the rest comments\\non long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references\\nto passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books\\nas Frazer\\'s _Golden Bough_ and Miss Murray\\'s _Witch-Cult in Western\\nEurope_. The cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illnesses and\\noutbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar\\ntale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of\\nneurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing\\nthe singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and\\nfresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle\\nhad recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly\\nknown to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode\\nIsland School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building\\nnear that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius\\nbut great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention\\nthrough the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of\\nrelating. He called himself \"psychically hypersensitive\", but the staid\\nfolk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \"queer\".\\nNever mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social\\nvisibility, and was now known only to a small group of esthetes from\\nother towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its\\nconservatism, had found him quite hopeless.\\n\\nOn the occasion of the visit, ran the professor\\'s manuscript, the\\nsculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host\\'s archeological\\nknowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He\\nspoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated\\nsympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the\\nconspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but\\narcheology. Young Wilcox\\'s rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough\\nto make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically\\npoetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which\\nI have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, \"It is new,\\nindeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and\\ndreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or\\ngarden-girdled Babylon.\"\\n\\nIt was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon\\na sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had\\nbeen a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable\\nfelt in New England for some years; and Wilcox\\'s imagination had been\\nkeenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of\\ngreat Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all\\ndripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics\\nhad covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point\\nbelow had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which\\nonly fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render\\nby the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_\".\\n\\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and\\ndisturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific\\nminuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief\\non which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only\\nin his nightclothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him.\\nMy uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness\\nin recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his\\nquestions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those\\nwhich tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies;\\nand Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence\\nwhich he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in\\nsome widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor\\nAngell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any\\ncult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands\\nfor future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the\\nfirst interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man,\\nduring which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose\\nburden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping\\nstone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously\\nin enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two\\nsounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters\\n\"_Cthulhu_\" and \"_R\\'lyeh_\".\\n\\nOn March 23rd, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and\\ninquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an\\nobscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman\\nStreet. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists\\nin the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of\\nunconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family,\\nand from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling\\noften at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to\\nbe in charge. The youth\\'s febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on\\nstrange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of\\nthem. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly\\ndreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing \"miles high\" which\\nwalked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object,\\nbut occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the\\nprofessor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity\\nhe had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this\\nobject, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man\\'s\\nsubsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not\\ngreatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to\\nsuggest true fever rather than mental disorder.\\n\\nOn April 2nd at about 3 p. m. every trace of Wilcox\\'s malady suddenly\\nceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and\\ncompletely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the\\nnight of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned\\nto his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no\\nfurther assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with\\nhis recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a\\nweek of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHere the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain\\nof the scattered notes gave me much material for thought--so much, in\\nfact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy\\ncan account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in\\nquestion were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons\\ncovering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his\\nstrange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a\\nprodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends\\nwhom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports\\nof their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time\\npast. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but\\nhe must, at the very least, have received more responses than any\\nordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original\\ncorrespondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and\\nreally significant digest. Average people in society and business--New\\nEngland\\'s traditional \"salt of the earth\"--gave an almost completely\\nnegative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless\\nnocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March\\n23rd and April 2nd--the period of young Wilcox\\'s delirium. Scientific\\nmen were little more affected, though four cases of vague description\\nsuggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there\\nis mentioned a dread of something abnormal.\\n\\nIt was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came,\\nand I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to\\ncompare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half\\nsuspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having\\nedited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently\\nresolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow\\ncognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been\\nimposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from esthetes told\\na disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion\\nof them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams\\nbeing immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor\\'s\\ndelirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported\\nscenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described;\\nand some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless\\nthing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with\\nemphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with\\nleanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on\\nthe date of young Wilcox\\'s seizure, and expired several months later\\nafter incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of\\nhell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely\\nby number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal\\ninvestigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a\\nfew. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often\\nwondered if all the objects of the professor\\'s questioning felt as\\npuzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever\\nreach them.\\n\\nThe press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic,\\nmania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell\\nmust have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was\\ntremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here\\nwas a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped\\nfrom a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter\\nto the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces\\na dire future from visions he has seen. A dispatch from California\\ndescribes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some\\n\"glorious fulfilment\" which never arrives, whilst items from India\\nspeak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March.\\nVoodoo orgies multiply in Haiti, and African outposts report ominous\\nmutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes\\nbothersome about this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by\\nhysterical Levantines on the night of March 22-23. The west of Ireland,\\ntoo, is full of wild rumor and legendry, and a fantastic painter named\\nArdois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous _Dream Landscape_ in the Paris spring\\nsalon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane\\nasylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity\\nfrom noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions.\\nA weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely\\nenvisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I\\nwas then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters\\nmentioned by the professor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                 _2. The Tale of Inspector Legrasse._\\n\\n\\nThe older matters which had made the sculptor\\'s dream and bas-relief so\\nsignificant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his\\nlong manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the\\nhellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown\\nhieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered\\nonly as \"_Cthulhu_\"; and all this in so stirring and horrible a\\nconnection that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries\\nand demands for data.\\n\\nThis earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before,\\nwhen the American Archeological Society held its annual meeting in\\nSt. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and\\nattainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was\\none of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took\\nadvantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering\\nand problems for expert solution.\\n\\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest\\nfor the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man\\nwho had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special\\ninformation unobtainable from any local source. His name was John\\nRaymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an inspector of police. With\\nhim he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and\\napparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss\\nto determine.\\n\\nIt must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest\\nin archeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted\\nby purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish,\\nor whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the\\nwooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo\\nmeeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with\\nit, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a\\ndark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than\\neven the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart\\nfrom the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured\\nmembers, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety\\nof the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place\\nthe frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its\\nfountain-head.\\n\\nInspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his\\noffering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the\\nassembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they\\nlost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure\\nwhose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted\\nso potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognized school of\\nsculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even\\nthousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of\\nunplaceable stone.\\n\\nThe figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close\\nand careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of\\nexquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely\\nanthropoid outline, but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass\\nof feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind\\nand fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed\\ninstinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat\\nbloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or\\npedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings\\ntouched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center,\\nwhilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs\\ngripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward\\nthe bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so\\nthat the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge forepaws\\nwhich clasped the croucher\\'s elevated knees. The aspect of the whole\\nwas abnormally lifelike, and the more subtly fearful because its source\\nwas so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was\\nunmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art\\nbelonging to civilization\\'s youth--or indeed to any other time.\\n\\nTotally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the\\nsoapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and\\nstriations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The\\ncharacters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present,\\ndespite a representation of half the world\\'s expert learning in this\\nfield, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic\\nkinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something\\nhorribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something\\nfrightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which\\nour world and our conceptions have no part.\\n\\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed\\ndefeat at the inspector\\'s problem, there was one man in that gathering\\nwho suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and\\nwriting, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle\\nhe knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, professor of\\nanthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note.\\n\\nProfessor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour\\nof Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which\\nhe failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast\\nhad encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Eskimos whose\\nreligion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its\\ndeliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which\\nother Eskimos knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders,\\nsaying that it had come down from horribly ancient eons before ever the\\nworld was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were\\ncertain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or\\n_tornasuk_; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic\\ncopy from an aged _angekok_ or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in\\nRoman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance\\nwas the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they\\ndanced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the\\nprofessor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a\\nhideous picture and some cryptic writing. And as far as he could tell,\\nit was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing\\nnow lying before the meeting.\\n\\nThese data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled\\nmembers, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at\\nonce to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an\\noral ritual among the swamp cult-worshipers his men had arrested, he\\nbesought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken\\ndown amongst the diabolist Eskimos. There then followed an exhaustive\\ncomparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both\\ndetective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase\\ncommon to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What,\\nin substance, both the Eskimo wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests\\nhad chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this--the\\nword-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase\\nas chanted aloud:\\n\\n        \"_Ph\\'nglui mglw\\'nafh Cthulhu R\\'lyeh wgah\\'nagl fhtagn._\"\\n\\nLegrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among\\nhis mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had\\ntold them the words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:\\n\\n         \"In his house at R\\'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAnd now, in response to a general urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse\\nrelated as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers;\\ntelling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound\\nsignificance. It savored of the wildest dreams of myth-maker and\\ntheosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination\\namong such half-castes and pariahs as might be least expected to\\npossess it.\\n\\nOn November 1st, 1907, there had come to New Orleans police a frantic\\nsummons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters\\nthere, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte\\'s men,\\nwere in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen\\nupon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more\\nterrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and\\nchildren had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its\\nincessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller\\nventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling\\nchants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added,\\nthe people could stand it no more.\\n\\nSo a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile,\\nhad set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a\\nguide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles\\nsplashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day\\nnever came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss\\nbeset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragments of a\\nrotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression\\nwhich every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create.\\nAt length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in\\nsight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of\\nbobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible\\nfar, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals\\nwhen the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through\\nthe pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant\\neven to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused\\npoint-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy\\nworship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on\\nunguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod\\nbefore.\\n\\nThe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil\\nrepute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were\\nlegends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a\\nhuge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters\\nwhispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner\\nearth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been there before\\nD\\'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the\\nwholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and\\nto see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to\\nkeep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe\\nof this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps\\nthe very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the\\nshocking sounds and incidents.\\n\\nOnly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by\\nLegrasse\\'s men as they plowed on through the black morass toward the\\nred glare and the muffled tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar\\nto men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible\\nto hear the one when the source should yield the other. Animal fury\\nand orgiastic license here whipped themselves to demoniac heights by\\nhowls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those\\nnighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now\\nand then the less organized ululations would cease, and from what\\nseemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong\\nchant that hideous phrase or ritual:\\n\\n        \"_Ph\\'nglui mglw\\'nafh Cthulhu R\\'lyeh wgah\\'nagl fhtagn._\"\\n\\nThen the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came\\nsuddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one\\nfainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony\\nof the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the\\nface of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized\\nwith horror.\\n\\nIn a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an\\nacre\\'s extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and\\ntwisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a\\nSime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn\\nwere braying, bellowing and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped\\nbonfire; in the center of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the\\ncurtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in\\nheight; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the\\nnoxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up\\nat regular intervals with the flame-girt monolith as a center hung,\\nhead downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who\\nhad disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers\\njumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from\\nleft to right in endless bacchanale between the ring of bodies and the\\nring of fire.\\n\\nIt may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes\\nwhich induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard\\nantiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot\\ndeeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph\\nD. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly\\nimaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of\\ngreat wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white\\nbulk beyond the remotest trees--but I suppose he had been hearing too\\nmuch native superstition.\\n\\nActually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief\\nduration. Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a\\nhundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their\\nfirearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For five\\nminutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild\\nblows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in\\nthe end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners,\\nwhom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows\\nof policemen. Five of the worshipers lay dead, and two severely\\nwounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their\\nfellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully\\nremoved and carried back by Legrasse.\\n\\nExamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness,\\nthe prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and\\nmentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes\\nand mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape\\nVerde Islands, gave a coloring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult.\\nBut before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something\\nfar deeper and older than negro fetishism was involved. Degraded and\\nignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprizing consistency\\nto the central idea of their loathsome faith.\\n\\nThey worshiped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before\\nthere were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky.\\nThose Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but\\ntheir dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first man,\\nwho formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the\\nprisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in\\ndistant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when\\nthe great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of\\nR\\'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath\\nhis sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the\\nsecret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.\\n\\nMeanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture\\ncould not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious\\nthings of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful\\nfew. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the\\nOld Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether\\nor not the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old\\nwriting now, but things were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual\\nwas not the secret--that was never spoken aloud, only whispered. The\\nchant meant only this: \"In his house at R\\'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits\\ndreaming.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOnly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and\\nthe rest were committed to various institutions. All denied a part\\nin the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done\\nby Black-winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial\\nmeeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no\\ncoherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract\\ncame mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed\\nto have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the\\ncult in the mountains of China.\\n\\nOld Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the\\nspeculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent\\nand transient indeed. There had been eons when other Things ruled on\\nthe earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the\\ndeathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean\\nstones on islands in the Pacific. They all died vast epochs of time\\nbefore man came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the\\nstars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of\\neternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought\\nTheir images with Them.\\n\\nThese Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether\\nof flesh and blood. They had shape--for did not this star-fashioned\\nimage prove it?--but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars\\nwere right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky;\\nbut when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They\\nno longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone\\nhouses in Their great city of R\\'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty\\nCthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might\\nonce more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside\\nmust serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them\\nintact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They\\ncould only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions\\nof years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe,\\nfor Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked\\nin Their tombs. When, after infinities of chaos, the first men came,\\nthe Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by molding their\\ndreams; for only thus could Their language reach the fleshly minds of\\nmammals.\\n\\nThen, whispered Castro, those first men formed the cult around small\\nidols which the Great Ones showed them; idols brought in dim eras\\nfrom dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right\\nagain, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb\\nto revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would\\nbe easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old\\nOnes; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals\\nthrown aside and all men shouting and killing and reveling in joy. Then\\nthe liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill\\nand revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a\\nholocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate\\nrites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow\\nforth the prophecy of their return.\\n\\nIn the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in\\ndreams, but then something had happened. The great stone city R\\'lyeh,\\nwith its monoliths and sepulchers, had sunk beneath the waves; and the\\ndeep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even\\nthought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse. But memory\\nnever died, and high priests said that the city would rise again when\\nthe stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of\\nearth, moldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumors picked up in caverns\\nbeneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak\\nmuch. He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or\\nsubtlety could elicit more in this direction. The _size_ of the Old\\nOnes, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said that\\nhe thought the center lay amid the pathless deserts of Arabia, where\\nIrem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not\\nallied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its\\nmembers. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless\\nChinamen said that there were double meanings in the _Necronomicon_\\nof the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they\\nchose, especially the much-discussed couplet:\\n\\n    \"That is not dead which can eternal lie,\\n    And with strange eons even death may die.\"\\n\\nLegrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired\\nin vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult. Castro,\\napparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly\\nsecret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon\\neither cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest\\nauthorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale\\nof Professor Webb.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasse\\'s tale,\\ncorroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent\\ncorrespondence of those who attended, although scant mention occurs in\\nthe formal publication of the society. Caution is the first care of\\nthose accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse\\nfor some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter\\'s\\ndeath it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I\\nviewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably\\nakin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox.\\n\\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not\\nwonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge\\nof what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man\\nwho had _dreamed_ not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the\\nswamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come _in his\\ndreams_ upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered\\nalike by Eskimo diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell\\'s\\ninstant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was\\neminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having\\nheard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series\\nof dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle\\'s expense.\\nThe dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of\\ncourse, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the\\nextravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the\\nmost sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript\\nagain and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with\\nthe cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see\\nthe sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly\\nimposing upon a learned and aged man.\\n\\nWilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas\\nStreet, a hideous Victorian imitation of Seventeenth Century Breton\\narchitecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely\\nColonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the\\nfinest Georgian steeple in America. I found him at work in his rooms,\\nand at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius\\nis indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, be heard from\\nsometime as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallized in clay\\nand will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasies which\\nArthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in\\nverse and in painting.\\n\\nDark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my\\nknock and asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I\\nwas, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity\\nin probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for\\nthe study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought\\nwith some subtlety to draw him out.\\n\\nIn a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he\\nspoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their\\nsubconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he showed\\nme a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency\\nof its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original\\nof this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had\\nformed themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the\\ngiant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing of\\nthe hidden cult, save from what my uncle\\'s relentless catechism had let\\nfall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in\\nwhich he could possibly have received the weird impressions.\\n\\nHe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me\\nsee with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green\\nstone--whose _geometry_, he oddly said, was _all wrong_--and hear\\nwith frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from\\nunderground: \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_,\" \"_Cthulhu fhtagn_.\"\\n\\nThese words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead\\nCthulhu\\'s dream-vigil in his stone vault at R\\'lyeh, and I felt deeply\\nmoved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of\\nthe cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass\\nof his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its\\nsheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams,\\nin the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his\\nimposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was of\\na type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill-mannered, which I\\ncould never like; but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius\\nand his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the\\nsuccess his talent promises.\\n\\nThe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times\\nI had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and\\nconnections. I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others\\nof that old-time raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even\\nquestioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro,\\nunfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so\\ngraphically at first hand, though it was really no more than a detailed\\nconfirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I\\nfelt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and\\nvery ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist\\nof note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, _as I wish\\nit still were_, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity\\nthe coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by\\nProfessor Angell.\\n\\nOne thing which I began to suspect, and which I now fear I _know_, is\\nthat my uncle\\'s death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill\\nstreet leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign\\nmongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor. I did not forget\\nthe mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana,\\nand would not be surprized to learn of secret methods and poison\\nneedles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and\\nbeliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in\\nNorway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper\\ninquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor\\'s data have come\\nto sinister ears? I thing Professor Angell died because he knew too\\nmuch, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go as\\nhe did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    _3. The Madness from the Sea._\\n\\n\\nIf heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing\\nof the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray\\npiece of shelf-paper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have\\nstumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of\\nan Australian journal, _Sydney Bulletin_ for April 18, 1925. It had\\nescaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance\\nbeen avidly collecting material for my uncle\\'s research.\\n\\nI had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called\\nthe \"Cthulhu Cult,\" and was visiting a learned friend of Paterson,\\nNew Jersey, the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note.\\nExamining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage\\nshelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd\\npicture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the\\n_Sydney Bulletin_ I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations\\nin all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut\\nof a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had\\nfound in the swamp.\\n\\nEagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item\\nin detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length.\\nWhat it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my\\nflagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It\\nread as follows:\\n\\n                     MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA\\n\\n    _Vigilant_ Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.\\n    One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle\\n    and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange\\n    Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.\\n\\n        *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n    The Morrison Co.\\'s freighter _Vigilant_, bound from Valparaiso,\\n    arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow\\n    the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht _Alert_ of\\n    Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34° 21\\',\\n    W. Longitude 152° 17\\', with one living and one dead man aboard.\\n\\n    The _Vigilant_ left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2d was\\n    driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy\\n    storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted;\\n    and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain\\n    one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had\\n    evidently been dead for more than a week.\\n\\n    The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown\\n    origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities\\n    at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College\\n    Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says\\n    he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of\\n    common pattern.\\n\\n    This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange\\n    story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian\\n    of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted\\n    schooner _Emma_ of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th,\\n    with a complement of eleven men.\\n\\n    The _Emma_, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her\\n    course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22d, in S.\\n    Latitude 49° 51´, W. Longitude 128° 34´, encountered the _Alert_,\\n    manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes.\\n    Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused;\\n    whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without\\n    warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass\\n    cannon forming part of the yacht\\'s equipment.\\n\\n    The _Emma\\'s_ men showed fight, says the survivor, and though the\\n    schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed\\n    to heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the\\n    savage crew on the yacht\\'s deck, and being forced to kill them all,\\n    the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly\\n    abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting.\\n\\n    Three of the _Emma\\'s_ men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate\\n    Green, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate\\n    Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in\\n    their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering\\n    back had existed.\\n\\n    The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island,\\n    although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six\\n    of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent\\n    about this part of his story and speaks only of their falling into\\n    a rock chasm.\\n\\n    Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried\\n    to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd.\\n\\n    From that time till his rescue on the 12th, the man remembers\\n    little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his\\n    companion, died. Briden\\'s death reveals no apparent cause, and was\\n    probably due to excitement or exposure.\\n\\n    Cable advices from Dunedin report that the _Alert_ was well known\\n    there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the\\n    waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose\\n    frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little\\n    curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm\\n    and earth tremors of March 1st.\\n\\n    Our Auckland correspondent gives the _Emma_ and her crew an\\n    excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and\\n    worthy man.\\n\\n    The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter\\n    beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce\\n    Johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThis was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what\\na train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of\\ndata on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests\\nat sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to\\norder back the _Emma_ as they sailed about with their hideous idol?\\nWhat was the unknown island on which six of the _Emma\\'s_ crew had\\ndied, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the\\nvice-admiralty\\'s investigation brought out, and what was known of the\\nnoxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvelous of all, what deep and more\\nthan natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now\\nundeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully\\nnoted by my uncle?\\n\\nMarch 1st--our February 28th according to the International Date\\nLine--the earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the _Alert_ and\\nher noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned,\\nand on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to\\ndream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had\\nmolded in his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23rd the\\ncrew of the _Emma_ landed on an unknown island and left six men dead;\\nand on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened\\nvividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster\\'s malign pursuit,\\nwhilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly\\ninto delirium! And what of this storm of April 2nd--the date on which\\nall dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from\\nthe bondage of strange fever? What of all this--and of those hints of\\nold Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign;\\ntheir faithful cult _and their mastery of dreams_? Was I tottering on\\nthe brink of cosmic horrors beyond man\\'s power to bear? If so, they\\nmust be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April\\nhad put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of\\nmankind\\'s soul.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThat evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my\\nhost adieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month\\nI was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of\\nthe strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea taverns.\\nWaterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there\\nwas vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during\\nwhich faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills.\\n\\nIn Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned _with yellow hair\\nturned white_ after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at\\nSydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed\\nwith his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience\\nhe would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty\\nofficials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo address.\\n\\nAfter that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and\\nmembers of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the _Alert_, now sold and\\nin commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing\\nfrom its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttlefish\\nhead, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was\\npreserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well,\\nfinding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the\\nsame utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of\\nmaterial which I had noted in Legrasse\\'s smaller specimen. Geologists,\\nthe curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed\\nthat the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of\\nwhat old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones: \"They\\nhad come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them.\"\\n\\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I\\nnow resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I\\nre-embarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day\\nlanded at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg.\\n\\nJohansen\\'s address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold\\nHaardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries\\nthat the greater city masqueraded as \"Christiania.\" I made the brief\\ntrip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat\\nand ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black\\nanswered my summons, and I was stung with disappointment when she told\\nme in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no more.\\n\\nHe had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at\\nsea in 1925 had broken him. He had told her no more than he had told\\nthe public, but had left a long manuscript--of \"technical matters\" as\\nhe said--written in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from\\nthe peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near\\nthe Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window\\nhad knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his\\nfeet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians\\nfound no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a\\nweakened constitution.\\n\\nI now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave\\nme till I, too, am at rest; \"accidentally\" or otherwise. Persuading the\\nwidow that my connection with her husband\\'s \"technical matters\" was\\nsufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away\\nand began to read it on the London boat.\\n\\nIt was a simple, rambling thing--a naive sailor\\'s effort at a\\npost-facto diary--and strove to recall day by day that last awful\\nvoyage. I can not attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its\\ncloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to show why\\nthe sound of the water against the vessel\\'s sides became so unendurable\\nto me that I stopped my ears with cotton.\\n\\nJohansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the\\ncity and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think\\nof the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space,\\nand of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream\\nbeneath the sea, known and favored by a nightmare cult ready and eager\\nto loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave\\ntheir monstrous stone city again to the sun and air.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nJohansen\\'s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty.\\nThe _Emma_, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had\\nfelt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have\\nheaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men\\'s dreams.\\nOnce more under control, the ship was making good progress when held\\nup by the _Alert_ on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate\\'s regret as\\nhe wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends\\non the _Alert_ he speaks with significant horror. There was some\\npeculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction\\nseem almost a duty, and Johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the charge\\nof ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the\\ncourt of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured\\nyacht under Johansen\\'s command, the men sight a great stone pillar\\nsticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47° 9\\', W. Longitude 126°\\n43\\' come upon a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean\\nmasonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of\\nearth\\'s supreme terror--the nightmare corpse-city of R\\'lyeh, that\\nwas built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome\\nshapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu\\nand his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last,\\nafter cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams\\nof the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a\\npilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not\\nsuspect, but God knows he soon saw enough!\\n\\nI suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned\\ncitadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the\\nwaters. When I think of the _extent_ of all that may be brooding down\\nthere I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were\\nawed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder demons,\\nand must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or\\nof any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone\\nblocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the\\nstupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the\\nqueer image found in the shrine on the _Alert_, is poignantly visible\\nin every line of the mate\\'s frightened description.\\n\\nWithout knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something\\nvery close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing\\nany definite structure or building, he dwells only on the broad\\nimpressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--surfaces too great to\\nbelong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with\\nhorrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about _angles_\\nbecause it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams.\\nHe had said that the _geometry_ of the dream-place he saw was abnormal,\\nnon-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart\\nfrom ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing\\nat the terrible reality.\\n\\nJohansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous\\nAcropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which\\ncould have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed\\ndistorted when viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from\\nthis sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked\\nleeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second\\nglance showed concavity after the first showed convexity.\\n\\nSomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before\\nanything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each\\nwould have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was\\nonly half-heartedly that they searched--vainly, as it proved--for some\\nportable souvenir to bear away.\\n\\nIt was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith\\nand shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked\\ncuriously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon\\nbas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all\\nfelt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and\\njambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like\\na trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would\\nhave said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be\\nsure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative\\nposition of everything else seemed fantasmally variable.\\n\\nBriden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then\\nDonovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point\\nseparately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque\\nstone molding--that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not\\nafter all horizontal--and the men wondered how any door in the universe\\ncould be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel\\nbegan to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced.\\n\\nDonovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and\\nrejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the\\nmonstrously carven portal. In this fantasy of prismatic distortion it\\nmoved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter\\nand perspective seemed upset.\\n\\nThe aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That\\ntenebrousness was indeed a _positive quality_; for it obscured such\\nparts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually\\nburst forth like smoke from its eon-long imprisonment, visibly\\ndarkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky\\non flapping membranous wings. The odor arising from the newly opened\\ndepths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought\\nhe heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and\\neveryone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight\\nand gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black\\ndoorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.\\n\\nPoor Johansen\\'s handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of\\nthe six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure\\nfright in that accursed instant. The Thing can not be described--there\\nis no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy,\\nsuch eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.\\nA mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth\\na great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that\\ntelepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of\\nthe stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and\\nwhat an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent\\nsailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great\\nCthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.\\n\\nThree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. God\\nrest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan,\\nGuerrera and Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging\\nfrenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat,\\nand Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which\\nshouldn\\'t have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as\\nif it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and\\npulled desperately for the _Alert_ as the mountainous monstrosity\\nflopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of\\nthe water.\\n\\nSteam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure\\nof all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments\\nof feverish rushing up and down between wheels and engines to get\\nthe _Alert_ under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that\\nindescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on\\nthe masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing\\nfrom the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing\\nship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu\\nslid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising\\nstrokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing\\nshrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one\\nnight in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously.\\n\\nBut Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could\\nsurely overtake the _Alert_ until steam was fully up, he resolved\\non a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran\\nlightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty\\neddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted\\nhigher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against\\nthe pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern\\nof a demon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came\\nnearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on\\nrelentlessly.\\n\\nThere was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness\\nas of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and\\na sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant\\nthe ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then\\nthere was only a venomous seething astern; where--God in heaven!--the\\nscattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously\\n_recombining_ in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened\\nevery second as the _Alert_ gained impetus from its mounting steam.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThat was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the\\ncabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the\\nlaughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first\\nbold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then\\ncame the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his\\nconsciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid\\ngulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a\\ncomet\\'s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and\\nfrom the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating\\nchorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged\\nmocking imps of Tartarus.\\n\\nOut of that dream came rescue--the _Vigilant_, the vice-admiralty\\ncourt, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the\\nold house by the Egeberg. He could not tell--they would think him mad.\\nHe would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not\\nguess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories.\\n\\nThat was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box\\nbeside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall\\ngo this record of mine--this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced\\ntogether that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have\\nlooked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the\\nskies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison\\nto me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as\\npoor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still\\nlives.\\n\\nCthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone\\nwhich has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is\\nsunken once more, for the _Vigilant_ sailed over the spot after the\\nApril storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and\\nslay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been\\ntrapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world\\nwould by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end?\\nWhat has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness\\nwaits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering\\ncities of men. A time will come--but I must not and can not think! Let\\nme pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put\\ncaution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CALL OF CTHULHU ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

P. LOVECRAFT\\n\\n\\n     \"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras--dire stories of Celæno and\\n     the Harpies--may reproduce themselves in the brain of\\n     superstition--_but they were there before_. They are transcripts,\\n     types--the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should the\\n     recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come\\n     to affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from\\n     such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to\\n     inflict upon us bodily injury? Oh, least of all! _These terrors\\n     are of older standing. They date beyond body_--or without the\\n     body, they would have been the same.... That the kind of fear here\\n     treated is purely spiritual--that it is strong in proportion as it\\n     is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our\\n     sinless infancy--are difficulties the solution of which might\\n     afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and\\n     a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.\"--Charles\\n     Lamb: _Witches and Other Night-Fears_.\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\nWhen a traveler in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork\\nat the junction of the Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean\\'s Corners he\\ncomes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher, and\\nthe brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts\\nof the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts\\nseem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a\\nluxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the\\nplanted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely\\nscattered houses wear a surprizing uniform aspect of age, squalor, and\\ndilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions\\nfrom the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling\\ndoorsteps or in the sloping, rock-strewn meadows. Those figures are\\nso silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden\\nthings, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a\\nrise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods,\\nthe feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too\\nrounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and\\nsometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles\\nof tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.\\n\\nGorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the\\ncrude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road\\ndips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively\\ndislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills\\nchatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to\\nthe raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs.\\nThe thin, shining line of the Miskatonic\\'s upper reaches has an oddly\\nserpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills\\namong which it rises.\\n\\nAs the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their\\nstone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously\\nthat one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by\\nwhich to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village\\nhuddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain,\\nand wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an\\nearlier architectural period than that of the neighboring region. It\\nis not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses\\nare deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church\\nnow harbors the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet.\\nOne dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no\\nway to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a\\nfaint, malign odor about the village street, as of the massed mold and\\ndecay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place,\\nand to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across\\nthe level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward\\none sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.\\n\\nOutsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain\\nseason of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken\\ndown. The scenery, judged by any ordinary esthetic canon, is more\\nthan commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer\\ntourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship,\\nand strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to\\ngive reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age--since\\nthe Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town\\'s\\nand the world\\'s welfare at heart--people shun it without knowing\\nexactly why. Perhaps one reason--though it can not apply to uninformed\\nstrangers--is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having\\ngone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England\\nbackwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the\\nwell-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding.\\nThe average of their intelligence is wofully low, whilst their annals\\nreek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and\\ndeeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry,\\nrepresenting the two or three armigerous families which came from\\nSalem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay;\\nthough many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that\\nonly their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of\\nthe Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and\\nMiskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the moldering gambrel\\nroofs under which they and their ancestors were born.\\n\\nNo one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror,\\ncan say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak\\nof unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they\\ncalled forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and\\nmade wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and\\nrumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley,\\nnewly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a\\nmemorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps, in which\\nhe said:\\n\\n     It must be allow\\'d that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train\\n     of Dæmons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny\\'d; the\\n     cursed Voices of _Azazel_ and _Buzrael_, of _Beelzebub_ and\\n     _Belial_, being heard from under Ground by above a Score of\\n     credible Witnesses now living. I myself did not more than a\\n     Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the\\n     Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling,\\n     Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth\\n     cou\\'d raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves\\n     that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.\\n\\nMr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the\\ntext, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills\\ncontinued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to\\ngeologists and physiographers.\\n\\nOther traditions tell of foul odors near the hill-crowning circles of\\nstone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at\\ncertain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines;\\nwhile still others try to explain the Devil\\'s Hop Yard--a bleak,\\nblasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then,\\ntoo, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills\\nwhich grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are\\npsychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they\\ntime their eery cries in unison with the sufferer\\'s struggling breath.\\nIf they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they\\ninstantly flutter away chittering in demoniac laughter; but if they\\nfail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.\\n\\nThese tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come\\ndown from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old--older by\\nfar than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the\\nvillage one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient\\nBishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill\\nat the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture\\nto be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the Nineteenth Century\\nfactory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great\\nrings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more\\ngenerally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of\\nskulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizable\\ntable-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such\\nspots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many\\nethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory,\\npersist in believing the remains Caucasian.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nIt was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited\\nfarmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile\\nand a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5\\na. m. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled\\nbecause it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe\\nunder another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded,\\nand all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout\\nthe night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother\\nwas one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive\\nalbino woman of 35, living with an aged and half-insane father\\nabout whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered\\nin his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according\\nto the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child;\\nconcerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might--and\\ndid--speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed\\nstrangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a\\ncontrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to\\nmutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous\\nfuture.\\n\\nLavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a\\nlone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and\\ntrying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited\\nthrough two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to\\npieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was\\nfilled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had\\ntaught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old\\nWhateley\\'s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by\\nviolence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not\\nhelped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences,\\nLavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular\\noccupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a\\nhome from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nThere was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises\\nand the dogs\\' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor\\nor midwife presided at his coming. Neighbors knew nothing of him till\\na week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow\\ninto Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of\\nloungers at Osborn\\'s general store. There seemed to be a change in the\\nold man--an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which\\nsubtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear--though he\\nwas not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all\\nhe showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and\\nwhat he said of the child\\'s paternity was remembered by many of his\\nhearers years afterward.\\n\\n\"I dun\\'t keer what folks think--ef Lavinny\\'s boy looked like his pa, he\\nwouldn\\'t look like nothin\\' ye expeck. Ye needn\\'t think the only folks\\nis the folks hereabouts. Lavinny\\'s read some, an\\' has seed some things\\nthe most o\\' ye only tell abaout. I calc\\'late her man is as good a\\nhusban\\' as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an\\' ef ye knowed as much\\nabaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn\\'t ast no better church weddin\\' nor\\nher\\'n. Let me tell ye suthin\\'--_some day yew folks\\'ll hear a child o\\'\\nLavinny\\'s a-callin\\' its father\\'s name on the top o\\' Sentinel Hill!_\"\\n\\nThe only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life\\nwere old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl\\nSawyer\\'s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie\\'s visit was frankly one\\nof curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations;\\nbut Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley\\nhad bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of\\ncattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur\\'s family which ended only\\nin 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did\\nthe ramshackle Whateley barn seem over-crowded with livestock. There\\ncame a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count\\nthe herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old\\nfarmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anemic,\\nbloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper,\\nperhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi\\nand timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the\\nWhateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect\\nof incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice\\nduring the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern\\nsimilar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaven old man and his\\nslatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.\\n\\nIn the spring after Wilbur\\'s birth Lavinia resumed her customary\\nrambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy\\nchild. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the\\ncountry folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the\\nswift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit.\\nWilbur\\'s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his\\nbirth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in\\ninfants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds\\nshowed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant,\\nand no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to\\nwalk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to\\nremove.\\n\\nIt was somewhat after this time--on Hallowe\\'en--that a great blaze was\\nseen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like\\nstone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk\\nwas started when Silas Bishop--of the undecayed Bishops--mentioned\\nhaving seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother\\nabout an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a\\nstray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied\\nthe two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost\\nnoiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed\\nto think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure\\nabout the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair\\nof dark blue trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen\\nalive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the\\ndisarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to\\nfill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and\\ngrandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror\\nof 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.\\n\\nThe next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that\\n\"Lavinny\\'s black brat\" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only\\neleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its\\ndifference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it\\ndisplayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of\\nthree or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when\\nhe spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed\\nby Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he\\nsaid, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked\\nwith his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the\\nspoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity;\\nfor though he shared his mother\\'s and grandfather\\'s chinlessness, his\\nfirm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression on his\\nlarge, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood\\nand well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly\\nugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost\\ngoatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish\\nskin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon\\ndisliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all\\nconjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic\\nof Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the\\ndreadful name of _Yog-Sothoth_ in the midst of a circle of stones with\\na great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and\\nhe was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their\\nbarking menace.\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nMeanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably\\nincreasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to\\nrepair the unused parts of his house--a spacious, peaked-roofed affair\\nwhose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose\\nthree least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for\\nhimself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves\\nof strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard\\nlabor; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry\\nseemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had really begun\\nas soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been\\nput suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock.\\nNow, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no\\nless thorough craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight\\nboarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section--though many\\ndeclared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at\\nall. Less inexplicable was his fitting-up of another downstairs room\\nfor his new grandson--a room which several callers saw, though no one\\nwas ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper story. This chamber\\nhe lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to\\narrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and\\nparts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously\\nin odd corners of the various rooms.\\n\\n\"I made some use of \\'em,\" he would say as he tried to mend a torn\\nblack-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \"but\\nthe boy\\'s fitten to make better use of \\'em. He\\'d orter hev \\'em as well\\nsot as he kin for they\\'re goin\\' to be all of his larnin\\'.\"\\n\\nWhen Wilbur was a year and seven months old--in September of 1914--his\\nsize and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as\\na child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker.\\nHe ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother\\non all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer\\npictures and charts in his grandfather\\'s books, while Old Whateley\\nwould instruct and catechize him through long, hushed afternoons. By\\nthis time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who\\nwatched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a\\nsolid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end,\\nclose against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden\\nrunway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this\\nwork\\'s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly\\nlocked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur\\'s birth, had been\\nabandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer\\nonce stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was\\nquite discomposed by the singular odor he encountered--such a stench,\\nhe averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near\\nthe Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything\\nsane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk\\nhave never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.\\n\\nThe following months were void of visible events, save that everyone\\nswore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On\\nMay Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people\\nfelt, whilst the following Hallowe\\'en produced an underground rumbling\\nqueerly synchronized with bursts of flame--\"them witch Whateleys\\'\\ndoin\\'s\"--from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up\\nuncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his\\nfourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than\\nformerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first\\ntime people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in\\nhis goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and\\nchant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of\\nunexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now\\nbecome a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol\\nin order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of\\nthe weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine\\nguardians.\\n\\nThe few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the\\nground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up\\nsecond story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were\\ndoing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal\\ndegree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading\\nto the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich\\nVillage that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above.\\nThe loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of\\nthe cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they\\nrecalled tales of Old Whateley\\'s youth, and of the strange things that\\nare called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper\\ntime to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that\\ndogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently\\nas they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.\\n\\nIn 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the\\nlocal draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men\\nfit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at\\nsuch signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and\\nmedical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England\\nnewspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this\\ninvestigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and\\ncaused the _Boston Globe_ and _Arkham Advertiser_ to print flamboyant\\nSunday stories of young Wilbur\\'s precociousness, Old Whateley\\'s black\\nmagic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the\\nancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill\\nnoises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of\\nfifteen. His lip and cheek were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his\\nvoice had begun to break. Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place\\nwith both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention\\nto the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed\\nupper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the\\ntool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired, and like the\\nfaint odors which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles\\non the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and\\ngrinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers\\nmade so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle\\nin gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received\\ntheir visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare\\ncourt further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk.\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\nFor a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into\\nthe general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and\\nhardened to their May Eve and All-Hallow orgies. Twice a year they\\nwould light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the\\nmountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while\\nat all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely\\nfarmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds\\nin the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs,\\nand they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock\\nwas usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society\\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of\\nit, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world\\'s\\nattention to themselves.\\n\\nAbout 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature,\\nand bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great\\nsiege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the\\nsealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded\\nthat the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions\\nand even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void\\nbetween the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the\\ngreat central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy\\noutside tin stove-pipe.\\n\\nIn the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number\\nof whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under\\nhis window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of\\ngreat significance, and told the loungers at Osborn\\'s that he thought\\nhis time had almost come.\\n\\n\"They whistle jest in tune with my breathin\\' naow,\" he said, \"an\\' I\\nguess they\\'re gittin\\' ready to ketch my soul. They know it\\'s a-goin\\'\\naout, an\\' dun\\'t calc\\'late to miss it. Yew\\'ll know, boys, arter I\\'m\\ngone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they\\'ll keep up\\na-singin\\' an\\' laffin\\' till break o\\' day. Ef they dun\\'t, they\\'ll kinder\\nquiet daown like. I expeck them an\\' the souls they hunts fer hev some\\npretty tough tussles sometimes.\"\\n\\nOn Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned\\nby Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the\\ndarkness and telephoned from Osborn\\'s in the village. He found Old\\nWhateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous\\nbreathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino\\ndaughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from\\nthe vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of\\nrhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The\\ndoctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds\\noutside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their\\nendless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps\\nof the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural--too much, thought Dr.\\nHoughton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in\\nresponse to the urgent call.\\n\\nToward 1 o\\'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his\\nwheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.\\n\\n\"More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows--an\\' _that_ grows\\nfaster. It\\'ll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to\\nYog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye\\'ll find on page 751 _of the\\ncomplete edition_, an\\' _then_ put a match to the prison. Fire from\\nairth can\\'t burn it nohaow!\"\\n\\nHe was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of\\nwhippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while\\nsome indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he\\nadded another sentence or two.\\n\\n\"Feed it reg\\'lar, Willy, an\\' mind the quantity; but dun\\'t let it grow\\ntoo fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye\\nopens to Yog-Sothoth, it\\'s all over an\\' no use. Only them from beyont\\nkin make it multiply an\\' work.... Only them, the old uns as wants to\\ncome back....\"\\n\\nBut speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the\\nway the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more\\nthan an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew\\nshrunken lids over the glazing gray eyes as the tumult of birds faded\\nimperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled\\nwhilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t git him,\" he muttered in his heavy bass voice.\\n\\nWilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in\\nhis one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many\\nlibrarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days\\nare kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because\\nof certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his\\ndoor; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through\\nuse of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather\\'s\\ntime, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He\\nwas now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached\\nthe normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In\\n1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called\\nupon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and\\nthree-quarters feet tall.\\n\\nThrough all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino\\nmother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the\\nhills with him on May Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature\\ncomplained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.\\n\\n\"They\\'s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,\" she\\nsaid, \"an\\' naowadays they\\'s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur\\nGawd, I dun\\'t know what he wants nor what he\\'s a-tryin\\' to dew.\"\\n\\nThat Hallowe\\'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire\\nburned on Sentinel Hill as usual, but people paid more attention\\nto the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated\\nwhippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley\\nfarmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of\\npandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not\\nuntil dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying\\nsouthward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no\\none could quite be certain till later. None of the countryfolk seemed\\nto have died--but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never\\nseen again.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and\\nbegan moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl\\nSawyer told the loungers at Osborn\\'s that more carpentry was going on\\nin the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows\\non the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and\\nhis grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living\\nin one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried\\nand tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something\\nabout his mother\\'s disappearance, and very few ever approached his\\nneighborhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and\\nshowed no signs of ceasing its development.\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur\\'s\\nfirst trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener\\nLibrary at Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British\\nMuseum, the University of Buenos Aires, and the Library of Miskatonic\\nUniversity at Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he\\ndesperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty,\\nbearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic,\\nwhich was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall,\\nand carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn\\'s general store, this\\ndark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the\\ndreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library--the\\nhideous _Necronomicon_ of the mad Arab Alhazred in Olaus Wormius\\' Latin\\nversion, as printed in Spain in the Seventeenth Century. He had never\\nseen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the\\nuniversity grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great\\nwhite-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and\\ntugged frantically at its stout chain.\\n\\nWilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee\\'s\\nEnglish version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon\\nreceiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two\\ntexts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have\\ncome on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could\\nnot civilly refrain from telling the librarian--the same erudite Henry\\nArmitage (A. M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins)\\nwho had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with\\nquestions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or\\nincantation containing the frightful name _Yog-Sothoth_, and it puzzled\\nhim to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made\\nthe matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula\\nhe finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder\\nat the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version,\\ncontained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.\\n\\n    Nor is it to be thought [ran the text as Armitage mentally\\n    translated it] that man is either the oldest or the last of earth\\'s\\n    masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone.\\n    The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not\\n    in the spaces we know, but _between_ them. They walk serene and\\n    primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. _Yog-Sothoth_ knows the\\n    gate. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the gate. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the key and\\n    guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in\\n    _Yog-Sothoth_. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old,\\n    and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have\\n    trod earth\\'s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no\\n    one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes\\n    know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, _saving\\n    only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind_; and\\n    of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man\\'s\\n    truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is\\n    _They_. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words\\n    have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons.\\n    The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with\\n    Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet\\n    may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the\\n    cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice\\n    desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones\\n    whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen\\n    city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles?\\n    Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. _Iä\\n    Shub-Niggurath!_ As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at\\n    your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one\\n    with your guarded threshold. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the key to the gate,\\n    whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They\\n    shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and\\n    after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall\\n    They reign again.\\n\\nDr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard\\nof Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his\\ndim, hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of\\nprobable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draft of the\\ntomb\\'s cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like\\nthe spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of\\nmankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch\\nlike titan fantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and\\ntime.\\n\\nPresently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange,\\nresonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run\\nof mankind\\'s.\\n\\n\"Mr. Armitage,\" he said, \"I calc\\'late I\\'ve got to take that book home.\\nThey\\'s things in it I\\'ve got to try under sarten conditions that I\\ncan\\'t git here, an\\' it \\'ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold\\nme up. Let me take it along, sir, an\\' I\\'ll swar they wun\\'t nobody know\\nthe difference. I dun\\'t need to tell ye I\\'ll take good keer of it. It\\nwa\\'n\\'t me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is....\"\\n\\nHe stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian\\'s face, and his own\\ngoatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half ready to tell him he might\\nmake a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible\\nconsequences and checked himself. There was too much responsibility\\nin giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres.\\nWhateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.\\n\\n\"Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun\\'t be\\nso fussy as yew be.\" And without saying more he rose and strode out of\\nthe building, stooping at each doorway.\\n\\nArmitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied\\nWhateley\\'s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible\\nfrom the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and\\nrecalled the old Sunday stories in the _Advertiser_; these things, and\\nthe lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during\\nhis one visit there. Unseen things not of earth--or at least not of\\ntri-dimensional earth--rushed fetid and horrible through New England\\'s\\nglens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he had\\nlong felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some\\nterrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance\\nin the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He\\nlocked away the _Necronomicon_ with a shudder of disgust, but the room\\nstill reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. \"As a foulness\\nshall ye know them,\" he quoted. Yes--the odor was the same as that\\nwhich had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years\\nbefore. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and\\nlaughed mockingly at the village rumors of his parentage.\\n\\n\"Inbreeding?\" Armitage muttered half aloud to himself. \"Great God, what\\nsimpletons! Show them Arthur Machen\\'s _Great God Pan_ and they\\'ll think\\nit a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing--what cursed shapeless\\ninfluence on or off this three-dimensioned earth--was Wilbur Whateley\\'s\\nfather? Born on Candlemas--nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the\\ntalk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham--what walked\\non the mountains that May Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on\\nthe world in half-human flesh and blood?\"\\n\\nDuring the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible\\ndata on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He\\ngot in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended\\nOld Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the\\ngrandfather\\'s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich\\nVillage failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of\\nthe _Necronomicon_, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly,\\nseemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and\\ndesires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks\\nwith several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many\\nothers elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly\\nthrough varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual\\nfear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be\\ndone about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and\\nabout the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley.\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\nThe Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928,\\nand Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue.\\nHe had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley\\'s grotesque trip to Cambridge,\\nand of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the _Necronomicon_\\nat the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage\\nhad issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having\\ncharge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at\\nCambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get\\nhome again, as if he feared the results of being away long.\\n\\nEarly in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small\\nhours of the third Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild,\\nfierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and\\nterrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always\\nin mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there\\nrang out a scream from a wholly different throat--such a scream as\\nroused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever\\nafterward--such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or\\nwholly of earth.\\n\\nArmitage hastened into some clothing and rushed across the street and\\nlawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and\\nheard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library.\\nAn open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come\\nhad indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming,\\nnow fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded\\nunmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was\\ntaking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed\\nback the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among\\nthe others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to\\nwhom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two\\nhe motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a\\nwatchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided;\\nbut Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of\\nwhippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical\\npiping, as if in unison with the last breath of a dying man.\\n\\nThe building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew\\ntoo well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small\\ngenealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second\\nnobody dared to turn on the light; then Armitage summoned up his\\ncourage and snapped the switch. One of the three--it is not certain\\nwhich--shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered\\ntables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly\\nlost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.\\n\\nThe thing that lay half-bent on its side in a fetid pool of\\ngreenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall,\\nand the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It\\nwas not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its\\nchest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant\\nwhippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel\\nwere scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty\\ncanvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central\\ndesk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later\\nexplaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however,\\ncrowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not\\nwholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may\\nproperly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose\\nideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common\\nlife-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was\\npartly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the\\ngoatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the\\ntorso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so\\nthat only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth\\nunchallenged or uneradicated.\\n\\nAbove the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where\\nthe dog\\'s rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery,\\nreticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald\\nwith yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of\\ncertain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here\\nall human resemblance left off and sheer fantasy began. The skin was\\nthickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of\\nlong greenish-gray tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.\\nTheir arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some\\ncosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the\\nhips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to\\nbe a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of\\ntrunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences\\nof being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their\\nblack fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth\\'s giant\\nsaurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves\\nnor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically\\nchanged color, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the\\nnon-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as\\na deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest\\nas a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white\\nin the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was\\nnone; only the fetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the\\npainted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious\\ndiscoloration behind it.\\n\\nAs the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it\\nbegan to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage\\nmade no written record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that\\nnothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all\\ncorrelation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came\\nsome disjointed fragments evidently taken from the _Necronomicon_,\\nthat monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished.\\nThose fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like \"_N\\'gai,\\nn\\'gha\\'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y\\'hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth...._\"\\nThey trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in\\nrhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.\\n\\nThen came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised his head in a long,\\nlugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the\\nprostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside\\nthe window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and\\nabove the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a\\npanic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of\\nfeathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they\\nhad sought for prey.\\n\\nAll at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and\\nleaped nervously out the window by which it had entered. A cry rose\\nfrom the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no\\none must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was\\nthankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering\\nin, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this\\ntime two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the\\nvestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to\\nthe stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate\\nthing could be covered up.\\n\\nMeanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need\\nnot describe the _kind_ and _rate_ of shrinkage and disintegration that\\noccurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is\\npermissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face\\nand hands, the really human elements in Wilbur Whateley must have been\\nvery small. When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky\\nwhitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odor had nearly\\ndisappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at\\nleast, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his\\nunknown father.\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nYet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror.\\nFormalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details\\nwere duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich\\nand Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs\\nof the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great\\nagitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed\\nhills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping\\nsounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by\\nWhateley\\'s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and\\ncattle during Wilbur\\'s absence, had developed a wofully acute case\\nof nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome\\nboarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased\\'s\\nliving quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed\\na ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations\\nconcerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the\\ninnumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic\\nvalley.\\n\\nAn almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a\\nhuge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and\\nthe variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to\\nthose who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner\\'s\\ndesk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University,\\ntogether with the deceased\\'s collection of strange books, for study\\nand possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it\\nwas not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold\\nwith which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been\\ndiscovered.\\n\\nIt was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose.\\nThe hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs\\nbarked frantically all night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a\\npeculiar stench in the air. About 7 o\\'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy\\nat George Corey\\'s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed\\nfrenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows.\\nHe was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen;\\nand in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and\\nlowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared\\nwith him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs.\\nCorey.\\n\\n\"Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis\\' Corey--they\\'s suthin\\' ben\\nthar! It smells like thunder, an\\' all the bushes an\\' little trees is\\npushed back from the rud like they\\'d a haouse ben moved along of it.\\nAn\\' that ain\\'t the wust, nuther. They\\'s _prints_ in the rud, Mis\\'\\nCorey--great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep\\nlike a elephant had ben along, _only they\\'s a sight more nor four feet\\ncould make_. I looked at one or two afore I run, an\\' I see every one\\nwas covered with lines spreadin\\' aout from one place, like as if big\\npalm-leaf fans--twict or three times as big as any they is--hed of ben\\npaounded daown into the rud. An\\' the smell was awful, like what it is\\naraound Wizard Whateley\\'s ol\\' haouse....\"\\n\\nHere he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had\\nsent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information,\\nbegan telephoning the neighbors; thus starting on its rounds the\\noverture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally\\nSawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop\\'s, the nearest place to Whateley\\'s,\\nit became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally\\'s boy\\nChauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley\\'s,\\nand had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the\\npasturage where Mr. Bishop\\'s cows had been left out all night.\\n\\n\"Yes, Mis\\' Corey,\" came Sally\\'s tremulous voice over the party wire,\\n\"Cha\\'ncey he just come back a-post-in\\', and couldn\\'t haff talk fer\\nbein\\' scairt! He says Ol\\' Whateley\\'s haouse is all blowed up, with\\nthe timbers scattered raound like they\\'d ben dynamite inside; only\\nthe bottom floor ain\\'t through, but is all covered with a kind o\\'\\ntarlike stuff that smells awful an\\' drips daown offen the aidges onto\\nthe graoun\\' whar the side timbers is blowed away. An\\' they\\'s awful\\nkinder marks in the yard, tew--great raound marks bigger raound than a\\nhogshead, an\\' all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse.\\nCha\\'ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath\\nwider\\'n a barn is matted daown, an\\' all the stun walls tumbled every\\nwhich way wherever it goes.\\n\\n\"An\\' he says, says he, Mis\\' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth\\'s\\ncaows, frighted ez he was; an\\' faound \\'em in the upper pasture nigh the\\nDevil\\'s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on \\'em\\'s clean gone, an\\' nigh\\nhaff o\\' them that\\'s left is sucked most dry o\\' blood, with sores on \\'em\\nlike they\\'s ben on Whateley\\'s cattle ever senct Lavinny\\'s black brat\\nwas born. Seth he\\'s gone aout naow to look at \\'em, though I\\'ll vaow he\\nwun\\'t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley\\'s! Cha\\'ncey didn\\'t look\\nkeerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the\\npasturage, but he says he thinks it p\\'inted towards the glen rud to the\\nvillage.\\n\\n\"I tell ye, Mis\\' Corey, they\\'s suthin\\' abroad as hadn\\'t orter be\\nabroad, an\\' I fer one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to\\nthe bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin\\' of it. He\\nwa\\'n\\'t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an\\' I think he an\\'\\nOl\\' Whateley must a raised suthin\\' in that there nailed-up haouse as\\nain\\'t even so human as he was. They\\'s allus ben unseen things araound\\nDunwich--livin\\' things--as ain\\'t human an\\' ain\\'t good fer human folks.\\n\\n\"The graoun\\' was a\\'talkin\\' lass night, an\\' towards mornin\\' Cha\\'ncey\\nhe heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col\\' Spring Glen he couldn\\'t\\nsleep none. Then he thought he heerd another faintlike saound over\\ntowards Wizard Whateley\\'s--a kinder rippin\\' or tearin\\' o\\' wood, like\\nsome big box or crate was bein\\' opened fur off. What with this an\\'\\nthat, he didn\\'t git to sleep at all till sunup, an\\' no sooner was he\\nup this mornin\\', but he\\'s got to go over to Whateley\\'s an\\' see what\\'s\\nthe matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis\\' Corey! This dun\\'t mean no\\ngood, an\\' I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an\\'\\ndo suthin\\'. I know suthin\\' awful\\'s abaout, an\\' feel my time is nigh,\\nthough only Gawd knows jest what it is.\\n\\n\"Did your Luther take accaount o\\' whar them big tracks led tew? No?\\nWal, Mis\\' Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o\\' the glen,\\nan\\' ain\\'t got to your haouse yet, I calc\\'late they must go into the\\nglen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col\\' Spring Glen ain\\'t no\\nhealthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an\\' fireflies there never\\ndid act like they was creaters o\\' Gawd, an\\' they\\'s them as says ye kin\\nhear strange things a-rushin\\' an\\' a-talkin\\' in the air daown thar ef ye\\nstand in the right place, atween the rock falls an\\' Bear\\'s Den.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBy that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were\\ntrooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins\\nand Cold Spring Glen; examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints,\\nthe maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse,\\nand the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and road-sides.\\nWhatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into\\nthe great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and\\nbroken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging\\nunderbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had\\nslid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope.\\nFrom below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable fetor; and\\nit is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge\\nand argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror\\nin its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously\\nat first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone\\ntelephoned the news to the _Aylesbury Transcript_; but the editor,\\naccustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a\\nhumorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the\\nAssociated Press.\\n\\nThat night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded\\nas stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to\\nremain in open pasturage. About 2 in the morning a frightful stench and\\nthe savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye\\'s,\\non the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they\\ncould hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere\\noutside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbors, and Elmer was\\nabout to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their\\ndeliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly\\nfollowed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The\\ndogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family.\\nFrye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death\\nto go out into that black farmyard. The children and the women-folk\\nwhimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct\\nof defense which told them their lives depended on silence. At last\\nthe noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great\\nsnapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together\\nin the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died\\naway far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from\\nthe stable and the demoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen,\\nSelina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of\\nthe second phase of the horror.\\n\\nThe next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed,\\nuncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had\\noccurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen\\nto the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of\\nground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of\\nthe cattle, only about a quarter could be found and identified. Some of\\nthese were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot.\\nEarl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but\\nothers maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a\\nbranch that hovered about half-way between soundness and decadence,\\nmade darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practised on\\nthe hilltops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his\\nmemories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether\\nconnected with Wilbur and his grandfather.\\n\\nDarkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize\\nfor real defense. In a few cases closely related families would band\\ntogether and watch in the gloom under one roof; but, in general there\\nwas only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a\\nfutile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks\\nhandily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and\\nwhen the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had\\ngone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed\\nan offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture\\nto set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.\\n\\nWhen night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was\\nless huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and\\nthe Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague\\nsounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror\\na fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill.\\nAs before, the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the\\nblasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation\\nof the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the\\nmoving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along\\nthe same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed\\nshrubbery and saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when\\nthey saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the\\ninexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony\\ncliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed\\naround to the hill\\'s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail\\nended--or rather, reversed--there.\\n\\nIt was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and\\nchant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and\\nHallowmass. Now that very stone formed the center of a vast space\\nthrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly\\nconcave surface was a thick fetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness\\nobserved on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror\\nescaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down\\nthe hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same\\nas that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and\\nnormal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who\\nwas not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or\\nsuggested a plausible explanation.\\n\\nThursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily.\\nThe whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual\\npersistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 a. m. all the party\\ntelephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers\\nheard a fright-mad voice shriek out, \"Help, oh, my Gawd!...\" and some\\nthought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation.\\nThere was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew\\ntill morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called\\neveryone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The\\ntruth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed\\nmen trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was\\nhorrible, yet hardly a surprize. There were more swaths and monstrous\\nprints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an\\negg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be\\ndiscovered--only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had\\nbeen erased from Dunwich.\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nIn the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of\\nthe horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of\\na shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of\\nWilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation,\\nhad caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages\\nboth ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general\\nresemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being\\nabsolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of\\nthe linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet,\\ngiving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of\\ncryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied\\non the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used.\\nThe ancient books taken from Whateley\\'s quarters, while absorbingly\\ninteresting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible\\nlines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no\\nassistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with\\nan iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet--this one of a very\\ndifferent cast, and resembling Sanskrit more than anything else. The\\nold ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage,\\nboth because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and\\nbecause of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical\\nformulæ of antiquity and the Middle Ages.\\n\\nArmitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically\\nused by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times,\\nand which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of\\nthe Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital;\\nsince it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if,\\nas he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It\\nwas his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the\\nwriter would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech\\nthan his own, save perhaps in certain special formulæ and incantations.\\nAccordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption\\nthat the bulk of it was in English.\\n\\nDr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that\\nthe riddle was a deep and complex one, and that no simple mode of\\nsolution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified\\nhimself with the massed lore of cryptography, drawing upon the fullest\\nresources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the\\narcana of Trithemius\\' _Poligraphia_, Giambattista Porta\\'s _De Furtivis\\nLiterarum Notis_, De Vigenere\\'s _Traité des Chiffres_, Falconer\\'s\\n_Cryptomenysis Patefacta_, Davys\\' and Thicknesse\\'s Eighteenth Century\\ntreatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten,\\nand Klüber\\'s _Kryptographik_. He interspersed his study of the books\\nwith attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced\\nthat he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of\\ncryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are\\narranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with\\narbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities\\nseemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded\\nthat the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt\\nhanded down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several\\ntimes he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen\\nobstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear.\\nCertain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged\\ndefinitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was\\nindeed in English.\\n\\nOn the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and\\nDr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur\\nWhateley\\'s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and\\nit was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition\\nand general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the\\nfirst long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November\\n26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he\\nremembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of\\ntwelve or thirteen.\\n\\n    Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth, [it ran] which did not\\n    like, it being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That\\n    upstairs more ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is\\n    not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins\\'s collie\\n    Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he\\n    dast. I guess he won\\'t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula\\n    last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic\\n    poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off, if\\n    I can\\'t break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it.\\n    They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I\\n    can clear off the earth, and I guess Grandfather will be dead then,\\n    so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the\\n    formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will\\n    help, but they can not take body without human blood. That upstairs\\n    looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I\\n    make the Yoorish sign or blow the power of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it\\n    is near like them at May Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear\\n    off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and\\n    there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth\\n    said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.\\n\\nMorning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of\\nwakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but\\nsat at his table under the electric light turning page after page\\nwith shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He\\nhad nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she\\nbrought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a\\nmouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as\\na reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner\\nwere brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either.\\nToward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but\\nsoon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths\\nand menaces to man\\'s existence that he had uncovered.\\n\\nOn the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan\\ninsisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and\\nashen-gray. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully.\\nWednesday--the next day--he was back at the manuscript, and began to\\ntake copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had\\nalready deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little\\nin an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before\\ndawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see\\nhim and insisted that he cease work. He refused, intimating that it was\\nof the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the\\ndiary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.\\n\\nThat evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal\\nand sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a\\nhalf-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with\\na sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken.\\nWeakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all\\nin a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat\\npocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in\\nneed of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the\\ndoctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, \"_But\\nwhat, in God\\'s name, can we do?_\"\\n\\nDr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made\\nno explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the\\nimperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder\\nwanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals\\nthat something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic\\nreferences to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race\\nand all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder\\nrace of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world\\nwas in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it\\naway from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane\\nor phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of eons\\nago. At other times he would call for the dreaded _Necronomicon_ and\\nthe _Dæmonolatreia_ of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding\\nsome formula to check the peril he conjured up.\\n\\n\"Stop them, stop them!\" he would shout. \"Those Whateleys meant to let\\nthem in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do\\nsomething--it\\'s a blind business, but I know how to make the powder....\\nIt hasn\\'t been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to\\nhis death, and at that rate....\"\\n\\nBut Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and\\nslept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He\\nwoke late Friday, clear of head, though sober, with a gnawing fear and\\ntremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to\\ngo over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and\\nthe rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains\\nin the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and\\nterrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from\\nsecure places of storage, and diagrams and formulæ were copied with\\nfeverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of skepticism there was\\nnone. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the\\nfloor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them\\ncould feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman\\'s\\nraving.\\n\\nOpinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police,\\nand the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply\\ncould not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was\\nmade clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the\\nconference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all\\nday Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulæ and mixing chemicals\\nobtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the\\nhellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any\\nmaterial agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had\\nleft behind him--the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him,\\nwas to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich\\nhorror.\\n\\nMonday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task\\nin hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further\\nconsultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of\\nplan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty\\nmust remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out,\\nand believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on\\nWednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of\\nthe _Arkham Advertiser_ was a facetious little item from the Associated\\nPress, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of\\nDunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone\\nfor Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next\\nday was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage\\nknew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was\\nno other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others\\nhad done before him.\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nFriday morning Armitage, Rice and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich,\\narriving at the village about 1 in the afternoon. The day was pleasant,\\nbut even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent\\nseemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy\\nravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain top a\\ngaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the\\nair of hushed fright at Osborn\\'s store they knew something hideous\\nhad happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye\\nhouse and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich,\\nquestioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing\\nfor themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with\\ntheir lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks\\nin the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous\\nswaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down\\nSentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance,\\nand he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summit.\\n\\nAt length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had\\ncome from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone\\nreports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and\\ncompare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more\\neasily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be\\nfound in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now\\nthe car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all\\nof whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as\\nArmitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something\\nand turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep\\nhollow that yawned close by.\\n\\n\"Gawd,\" he gasped, \"I telled \\'em not ter go daown into the glen, an\\' I\\nnever thought nobody\\'d dew it with them tracks an\\' that smell an\\' the\\nwhippoorwills a-screechin\\' daown thar in the dark o\\' noonday....\"\\n\\nA cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear\\nseemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening.\\nArmitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its\\nmonstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be\\nhis. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous\\nblasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. _Negotium perambulans in\\ntenebris...._ The old librarian rehearsed the formulæ he had memorized,\\nand clutched the paper containing the alternative ones he had not\\nmemorized. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order.\\nRice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used\\nin combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which\\nhe relied despite his colleague\\'s warnings that no material weapon\\nwould be of help.\\n\\nArmitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind\\nof a manifestation to expect, but he did not add to the fright of the\\nDunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might\\nbe conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous\\nthing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced\\nto disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the\\npresent evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a\\nforce that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. They shook\\ntheir heads at the visitors\\' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near\\nthe glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the\\nwatchers again.\\n\\nThere were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills\\npiped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold\\nSpring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable fetor to the heavy night\\nair; such a fetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before,\\nwhen they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years\\nand a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear.\\nWhatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage\\ntold his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the\\ndark.\\n\\nMorning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a gray, bleak\\nday, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier\\nclouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the\\nnorthwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking\\nshelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed\\nFrye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the\\naggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless,\\nmonstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of\\nthunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then\\na forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed\\nglen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the\\nstorm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.\\n\\nIt was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a\\nconfused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought\\nto view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting,\\nand even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out\\nwords, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed\\na coherent form.\\n\\n\"Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd!\" the voice choked out; \"it\\'s a-goin\\' agin, _an\\'\\nthis time by day_! It\\'s aout--it\\'s aout an\\' a-movin\\' this very minute,\\nan\\' only the Lord knows when it\\'ll be on us all!\"\\n\\nThe speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.\\n\\n\"Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the \\'phone a-ringin\\', an\\'\\nit was Mis\\' Corey, George\\'s wife that lives daown by the junction.\\nShe says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin\\' in the caows from the\\nstorm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin\\' at the\\nmaouth o\\' the glen--opposite side ter this--an\\' smelt the same awful\\nsmell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las\\' Monday mornin\\'.\\nAn\\' she says he says they was a swishin\\', lappin\\' saound, more nor\\nwhat the bendin\\' trees an\\' bushes could make, an\\' all on a suddent the\\ntrees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an\\' they was a awful\\nstompin\\' an\\' splashin\\' in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn\\'t see\\nnothin\\' at all, only jest the bendin\\' trees an\\' underbrush.\\n\\n\"Then fur ahead where Bishop\\'s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a\\nawful creakin\\' an\\' strainin\\' on the bridge, an\\' says he could tell the\\nsaound o\\' wood a-startin\\' to crack an\\' split. An\\' all the whiles he\\nnever see a thing, only them trees an\\' bushes a-bendin\\'. An\\' when the\\nswishin\\' saound got very fur off--on the rud towards Wizard Whateley\\'s\\nan\\' Sentinel Hill--Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he\\'d heerd\\nit fust an\\' look at the graound. It was all mud an\\' water, an\\' the sky\\nwas dark, an\\' the rain was wipin\\' aout all tracks abaout as fast as\\ncould be; but beginnin\\' at the glen maouth, whar the trees bed moved,\\nthey was still some o\\' them awful prints big as bar\\'ls like he seen\\nMonday.\"\\n\\nAt this point the first excited speaker interrupted.\\n\\n\"But _that_ ain\\'t the trouble naow--that was only the start. Zeb here\\nwas callin\\' folks up an\\' everybody was a-listenin\\' in when a call from\\nSeth Bishop\\'s cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin\\' on fit ter\\nkill--she\\'d jest seed the trees a-bendin\\' beside the rud, an\\' says\\nthey was a kind o\\' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin\\' an\\' treadin\\',\\na-headin\\' fer the haouse. Then she up an\\' spoke suddent of a fearful\\nsmell, an\\' says her boy Cha\\'ncey was a-screamin\\' as haow it was jest\\nlike what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin\\'. An\\' the\\ndogs was all barkin\\' an\\' whinin\\' awful.\\n\\n\"An\\' then she let aout a turrible yell, an\\' says the shed daown the\\nrud hed jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind\\nwa\\'n\\'t strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin\\', an\\' ye\\ncould hear lots o\\' folks on the wire a-gaspin\\'. All to onct Sally she\\nyelled agin, an\\' says the front yard picket fence bed jest crumpled up,\\nthough they wa\\'n\\'t no sign o\\' what done it. Then everybody on the line\\ncould hear Cha\\'ncey an\\' ol\\' Seth Bishop a-yellin\\', tew, an\\' Sally was\\nshriekin\\' aout that suthin\\' heavy hed struck the haouse--not lightnin\\'\\nnor nothin\\', but suthin\\' heavy agin\\' the front, that kep\\' a-launchin\\'\\nitself agin an\\' agin, though ye couldn\\'t see nuthin\\' aout the front\\nwinders. An\\' then ... an\\' then....\"\\n\\nLines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was,\\nhad barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.\\n\\n\"An\\' then ... Sally she yelled aout, \\'O help, the haouse is a-cavin\\'\\nin\\' ... an\\' on the wire we could hoar a turrible crashin\\', an\\' a hull\\nflock o\\' screamin\\' ... jest like when Elmer Frye\\'s place was took, only\\nwuss....\"\\n\\nThe man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all--not a saound nor squeak over the \\'phone arter that. Jest\\nstill-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an\\' wagons an\\' raounded\\nup as many able-bodied men-folks as we could get, at Corey\\'s place,\\nan\\' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I\\nthink it\\'s the Lord\\'s judgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin\\never set aside.\"\\n\\nArmitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke\\ndecisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.\\n\\n\"We must follow it, boys.\" He made his voice as reassuring as possible.\\n\"I believe there\\'s a chance of putting it out of business. You men\\nknow that those Whateleys were wizards--well, this thing is a thing\\nof wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I\\'ve seen Wilbur\\nWhateley\\'s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to\\nread, and I think I know the right kind of a spell to recite to make\\nthe thing fade away. Of course, one can\\'t be sure, but we can always\\ntake a chance. It\\'s invisible--I knew it would be--but there\\'s a powder\\nin this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second.\\nLater on we\\'ll try it. It\\'s a frightful thing to have alive, but it\\nisn\\'t as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he\\'d lived longer.\\nYou\\'ll never know what the world has escaped. Now we\\'ve only this one\\nthing to fight, and it can\\'t multiply. It can, though, do a lot of\\nharm; so we mustn\\'t hesitate to rid the community of it.\\n\\n\"We must follow it--and the way to begin is to go to the place that has\\njust been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way--I don\\'t know your roads\\nvery well, but I\\'ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots.\\nHow about it?\"\\n\\nThe men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly,\\npointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.\\n\\n\"I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop\\'s quickest by cuttin\\' acrost the\\nlower medder here, wadin\\' the brook at the low place, an\\' climbin\\'\\nthrough Carrier\\'s mowin\\' an\\' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on\\nthe upper rud mighty nigh Seth\\'s--a leetle t\\'other side.\"\\n\\nArmitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction\\nindicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing\\nlighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When\\nArmitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him\\nand walked ahead to show the right one. Courage and confidence were\\nmounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill\\nwhich lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic\\nancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these\\nqualities to a severe test.\\n\\nAt length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out.\\nThey were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and\\nhideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few\\nmoments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It\\nwas the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was\\nfound in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house\\nand barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and the tarry\\nstickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints\\nleading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned\\nslopes of Sentinel Hill.\\n\\nAs the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley\\'s abode they shuddered\\nvisibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was\\nno joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not\\nsee, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a demon. Opposite the\\nbase of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh\\nbending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster\\'s\\nformer route to and from the summit.\\n\\nArmitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned\\nthe steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to\\nMorgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried\\nout sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain\\nspot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users\\nof optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focused the\\nlenses with Armitage\\'s aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained\\nthan Morgan\\'s had been.\\n\\n\"Gawd almighty, the grass an\\' bushes is a-movin\\'! It\\'s a-goin\\'\\nup--slow-like--creepin\\' up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows\\nwhat fer!\"\\n\\nThen the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one\\nthing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it.\\nSpells might be all right--but suppose they weren\\'t? Voices began\\nquestioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply\\nseemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close\\nproximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden, and\\nwholly outside the sane experience of mankind.\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\nIn the end the three men from Arkham--old, white-bearded Dr.\\nArmitage, stocky, iron-gray Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr.\\nMorgan--ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction\\nregarding its focusing and use, they left the telescope with the\\nfrightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they\\nwere watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around.\\nIt was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High\\nabove the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker\\nrepassed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the\\npursuers were gaining.\\n\\nCurtis Whateley--of the undecayed branch--was holding the telescope\\nwhen the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the\\ncrowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak\\nwhich overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the\\nshrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the\\nparty were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the\\ninvisible blasphemy had passed it.\\n\\nThen Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was\\nadjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about\\nto happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was\\nexpected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three\\nmen shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope\\nand strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the\\nparty\\'s point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent\\nchance of spreading the potent powder with marvelous effect.\\n\\nThose without the telescope saw only an instant\\'s flash of gray\\ncloud--a cloud about the size of a moderately large building--near the\\ntop of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it\\nwith a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled,\\nand would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others\\nseized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly:\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... _that ... that_....\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... that ... that.\"]\\n\\nThere was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought\\nto rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was\\npast all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Bigger \\'n a barn ... all made o\\' squirmin\\' ropes ... hull thing sort\\no\\' shaped like a hen\\'s egg bigger\\'n anything, with dozens o\\' legs like\\nhogsheads that haff shut up when they step ... nothin\\' solid abaout\\nit--all like jelly, an\\' made o\\' sep\\'rit wrigglin\\' ropes pushed clost\\ntogether ... great bulgin\\' eyes all over it ... ten or twenty maouths\\nor trunks a-stickin\\' aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an\\'\\nall a-tossin\\' an\\' openin\\' an\\' shuttin\\' ... all gray, with kinder blue\\nor purple rings ... _an\\' Gawd in Heaven--that haff face on top_!...\"\\n\\nThis final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis,\\nand he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and\\nWill Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp\\ngrass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the\\nmountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible\\nthree tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the\\nsteep incline allowed. Only these--nothing more. Then everyone noticed\\na strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in\\nthe underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered\\nwhippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note\\nof tense and evil expectancy.\\n\\nEarl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as\\nstanding on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone\\nbut at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed\\nto be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and\\nas Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a\\nfaint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant\\nwere accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that\\nremote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness\\nand impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for esthetic\\nappreciation. \"I guess he\\'s sayin\\' the spell,\" whispered Wheeler as\\nhe snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly,\\nand in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the\\nvisible ritual.\\n\\nSuddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any\\ndiscernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly\\nmarked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed\\nstrangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky.\\nLightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for\\nthe portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became\\nunmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all\\nraising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far\\naway came the frantic barking of dogs.\\n\\nThe change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd\\ngazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of\\nnothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky\\'s blue, pressed down\\nupon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat\\nbrighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had showed a\\ncertain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No\\none, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The\\nwhippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of\\nDunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with\\nwhich the atmosphere seemed surcharged.\\n\\nWithout warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which\\nwill never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not\\nfrom any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield\\nno such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came\\nfrom the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the\\naltar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them _sounds_\\nat all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to\\ndim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet\\none must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that\\nof half-articulate _words_. They were loud--loud as the rumblings and\\nthe thunder above which they echoed--yet did they come from no visible\\nbeing. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in\\nthe world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain\\'s\\nbase huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.\\n\\n\"_Ygnaiih ... ygnaiih ... thflthkh\\'ngha ... Yog-Sothoth...._\" rang the\\nhideous croaking out of space. \"_Y\\'bthnk ... h\\'ehye ... n\\'grkdl\\'lh...._\"\\n\\nThe speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful\\npsychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at\\nthe telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human\\nfigures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange\\ngestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what\\nblack wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of\\nextra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those\\nhalf-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather\\nrenewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate\\nfrenzy.\\n\\n\"_Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah ... e\\'yaya-yayaaaa ... ngh\\'aaaa ... ngh\\'aaaa_ ...\\nh\\'yuh ... h\\'yuh ... HELP! HELP! ... _ff--ff--ff_--FATHER! FATHER!\\nYOG-SOTHOTH!...\"\\n\\nBut that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at\\nthe _indisputably English_ syllables that had poured thickly and\\nthunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking\\naltar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they\\njumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills;\\nthe deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or\\nsky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning bolt shot\\nfrom the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of\\nviewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to\\nall the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a\\nfury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain\\'s base, weakened by the\\nlethal fetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled\\noff their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage\\nwilted to a curious, sickly yellow-gray, and over field and forest were\\nscattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.\\n\\nThe stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again.\\nTo this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on\\nand around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining\\nconsciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the\\nbeams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave\\nand quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more\\nterrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state\\nof cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook\\ntheir heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.\\n\\n\"The thing has gone for ever,\" Armitage said. \"It has been split up\\ninto what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was\\nan impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really\\nmatter in any sense we know. It was like its father--and most of it has\\ngone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material\\nuniverse; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of\\nhuman blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.\"\\n\\nThere was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of\\npoor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so\\nthat he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick\\nitself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had\\nprostrated him burst in upon him again.\\n\\n\"_Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face ... that haff face on top of it ...\\nthat face with the red eyes an\\' crinkly albino hair, an\\' no chin, like\\nthe Whateleys.... It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o\\' thing,\\nbut they was a haff-shaped man\\'s face on top of it, an\\' it looked like\\nWizard Whateley\\'s, only it was yards an\\' yards acrost...._\"\\n\\nHe paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a\\nbewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon\\nWhateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been\\nsilent heretofore, spoke aloud.\\n\\n\"Fifteen year\\' gone,\" he rambled, \"I heerd Ol\\' Whateley say as haow\\nsome day we\\'d hear a child o\\' Lavinny\\'s a-callin\\' its father\\'s name on\\nthe top o\\' Sentinel Hill....\"\\n\\nBut Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.\\n\\n\"_What was it, anyhaow_, an\\' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it\\naout o\\' the air it come from?\"\\n\\nArmitage chose his words carefully.\\n\\n\"It was--well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn\\'t belong in our\\npart of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself\\nby other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business\\ncalling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people\\nand very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur\\nWhateley himself--enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of\\nhim, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I\\'m going\\nto burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you\\'ll dynamite\\nthat altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing\\nstones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings\\nthose Whateleys were so fond of--the beings they were going to let in\\ntangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some\\nnameless place for some nameless purpose.\\n\\n\"But as to this thing we\\'ve just sent back--the Whateleys raised it for\\na terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big\\nfrom the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big--but it beat him\\nbecause it had a greater share of the _outsideness_ in it. You needn\\'t\\nask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn\\'t call it out. _It was\\nhis twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did._\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DUNWICH HORROR ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It is altogether against my will that\\nI tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the\\nantarctic--with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and\\nmelting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more reluctant because my\\nwarning may be in vain.\\n\\nDoubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet,\\nif I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would\\nbe nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary\\nand aërial, will count in my favor, for they are damnably vivid and\\ngraphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths to\\nwhich clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will\\nbe jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness and\\ntechnique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.\\n\\nIn the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few\\nscientific leaders who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence\\nof thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or\\nin the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles;\\nand on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring\\nworld in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region\\nof those mountains of madness.\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and\\nmy associates, connected only with a small university, have little\\nchance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or\\nhighly controversial natures are concerned.\\n\\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense,\\nspecialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a\\ngeologist, my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition\\nwas wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from\\nvarious parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill\\ndevised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department.\\n\\nI had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did\\nhope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points\\nalong previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a\\nsort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.\\n\\nPabodie\\'s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our\\nreports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and\\ncapacity to combine the ordinary Artesian drill principle with the\\nprinciple of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope\\nquickly with strata of varying hardness.\\n\\nSteel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick,\\ndynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional\\npiping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all\\nformed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog\\nsledges could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum\\nalloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned.\\n\\nFour large Dornier aëroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous\\naltitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added\\nfuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could\\ntransport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great\\nice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a\\nsufficient quota of dogs would serve us.\\n\\nWe planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season--or\\nlonger, if absolutely necessary--would permit, operating mostly in the\\nmountain ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored\\nin varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With\\nfrequent changes of camp, made by aëroplane and involving distances\\ngreat enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a\\nquite unprecedented amount of material--especially in the pre-Cambrian\\nstrata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously\\nbeen secured.\\n\\nWe wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper\\nfossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of this bleak realm\\nof ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the\\nearth\\'s past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and\\neven tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the\\nlichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are\\nthe only survivors, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to\\nexpand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple\\nboring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by\\nblasting, in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition.\\n\\nOur borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the\\nupper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed,\\nland surfaces--these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the\\nmile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels.\\n\\nWe could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount\\nof more glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking\\ncopper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited\\nareas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo.\\n\\nIt is this plan--which we could not put into effect except\\nexperimentally on an expedition such as ours--that the coming\\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings\\nI have issued since our return from the antarctic.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent\\nwireless reports to the _Arkham Advertiser_ and Associated Press, and\\nthrough the later articles by Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four\\nmen from the University--Pabodie, Lake of the biology department,\\nAtwood of the physics department--also a meteorologist--and myself,\\nrepresenting geology and having nominal command, also sixteen\\nassistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled\\nmechanics.\\n\\nOf these sixteen, twelve were qualified aëroplane pilots, all but two\\nof whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood\\nnavigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood and I. In\\naddition, of course, our two ships--wooden exwhalers, reinforced for\\nice conditions and having auxiliary steam--were fully manned.\\n\\nThe Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special\\ncontributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations were\\nextremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity.\\n\\nThe dogs, sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of\\nour five planes were delivered in Boston, and there our ships were\\nloaded.\\n\\nWe were marvelously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in\\nall matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp\\nconstruction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent\\nand exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and\\nfame of these predecessors which made our own expedition--ample though\\nit was--so little noticed by the world at large.\\n\\nAs the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd,\\n1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama\\nCanal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter\\nplace we took on final supplies.\\n\\nNone of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before,\\nhence we all relied greatly on our ship captains--J. B. Douglas,\\ncommanding the brig _Arkham_, and serving as commander of the sea\\nparty, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque _Miskatonic_--both\\nveteran whalers in antarctic waters.\\n\\nAs we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in\\nthe north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day.\\nAt about 62° South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs--tablelike\\nobjects with vertical sides--and just before reaching the antarctic\\ncircle, which we crossed on October 20th with appropriately quaint\\nceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice.\\n\\nThe falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage\\nthrough the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to\\ncome. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me\\nvastly; these included a strikingly vivid mirage--the first I had ever\\nseen--in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable\\ncosmic castles.\\n\\nPushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive\\nnor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67°,\\nEast Longitude 175°. On the morning of October 26th a strong land\\nblink appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of\\nexcitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain\\nwhich opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had\\nencountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic\\nworld of frozen death.\\n\\nThese peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and\\nit would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east\\ncoast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo\\nSound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77° 9´.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren\\npeaks of mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low\\nnorthern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of\\nmidnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice\\nand water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope.\\n\\nThrough the desolate summits swept raging, intermittent gusts of\\nthe terrible antarctic wind, whose cadences sometimes held vague\\nsuggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes\\nextending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic\\nreason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible.\\n\\nSomething about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing\\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more\\ndisturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which\\noccur in the dreaded _Necronomicon_ of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. I\\nwas rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous\\nbook at the college library.\\n\\nOn the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been\\ntemporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried\\nthe cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long\\nline of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east\\nthe low, white line of the great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly\\nto a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec, and\\nmarking the end of southward navigation.\\n\\nIn the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in\\nthe lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriaceous peak towered up some\\ntwelve thousand seven hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a\\nJapanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, while beyond it rose the white,\\nghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand nine hundred feet in\\naltitude, and now extinct as a volcano.\\n\\nPuffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate\\nassistants--a brilliant young fellow named Danforth--pointed out what\\nlooked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain,\\ndiscovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe\\'s image\\nwhen he wrote seven years later:\\n\\n      \"--the lavas that restlessly roll\\n    Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek\\n      In the ultimate climes of the pole--\\n    That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\\n      In the realms of the boreal pole.\"\\n\\nDanforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a\\ngood deal of Poe. I was interested myself because of the antarctic\\nscene of Poe\\'s only long story--the disturbing and enigmatical _Arthur\\nGordon Pym_. On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the\\nbackground, myriad of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their\\nfins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or\\nsprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.\\n\\nUsing small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island\\nshortly after midnight, on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of\\ncable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means\\nof a breeches-buoy arrangement.\\n\\nOur sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and\\ncomplex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton\\nexpeditions had preceded us.\\n\\nOur camp on the frozen shore below the volcano\\'s slope was only a\\nprovisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the _Arkham_. We landed\\nall our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline\\ntanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and\\naërial, aëroplane parts, and other accessories, including three small\\nportable wireless outfits--besides those in the planes--capable of\\ncommunicating with the _Arkham\\'s_ large outfit from any part of the\\nantarctic continent that we would be likely to visit.\\n\\nThe ship\\'s outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey\\npress reports to the _Arkham Advertiser\\'s_ powerful wireless station\\non Kingsport Head, Mass. We hoped to complete our work during a single\\nantarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the\\n_Arkham_, sending the _Miskatonic_ north before the freezing of the ice\\nfor another summer\\'s supplies.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nI need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our\\nearly work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings\\nat several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which\\nPabodie\\'s apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers;\\nour provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous\\nascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final\\nassembling of five huge aëroplanes at the camp atop the barrier.\\n\\nThe health of our land party--twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge\\ndogs--was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no\\nreally destructive temperatures or windstorms.\\n\\nFor the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20° or 25°\\nabove, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to\\nrigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semipermanent, and destined\\nto be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other\\nsupplies.\\n\\nOnly four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring\\nmaterial, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men, from the\\nships, at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the\\n_Arkham_ in case all our exploring planes were lost.\\n\\nLater, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we\\nwould employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between\\nthis cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from six\\nhundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier.\\n\\nDespite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests\\nthat pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with\\nintermediate bases, taking our chances in the interest of economy and\\nprobable efficiency.\\n\\nWireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop\\nflight of our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with\\nvast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to\\nthe sound of our engines.\\n\\nWind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us\\nthrough the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed\\nahead, between Latitudes 83° and 84°, we knew we had reached Beardmore\\nGlacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen\\nsea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line.\\n\\nAt last we were truly entering the white, æon-dead world of the\\nultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen\\nin the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen\\nthousand feet.\\n\\nThe successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in\\nLatitude 86° 7´, East Longitude 174° 23´, and the phenomenally rapid\\nand effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by\\nour sledge trips and short aëroplane flights, are matters of history;\\nas is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and\\ntwo of the graduate students--Gedney and Carroll--on December 13th to\\n15th.\\n\\nWe were some eight thousand five hundred feet above sea-level. When\\nexperimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down\\nthrough the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of\\nthe small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at\\nmany places, where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing\\nmineral specimens.\\n\\nThe pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed\\nour belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the great bulk of\\nthe continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying\\neastward below South America--which we then thought to form a separate\\nand smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction\\nof Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the report.\\n\\nIn certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring\\nrevealed their nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings\\nand fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such\\nmollusks as linguellæ and gastropods--all of which seemed of real\\nsignificance in connection with the region\\'s primordial history. There\\nwas also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest\\ndiameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate\\nbrought up from a deep-blasted aperture.\\n\\nThese fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen\\nAlexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious\\nmarking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye\\nit looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in\\nthe sedimentary rocks.\\n\\nSince slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a\\nsedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces\\nodd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason\\nfor extreme wonder over the striated depression.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOn January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Daniels, all six of the students,\\nfour mechanics, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two\\nof the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind,\\nwhich, fortunately, did not develop into a typical storm. This was,\\nas the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, during\\nothers of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas\\nunreached by previous explorers.\\n\\nOur early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though\\nthey afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and\\ndeceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had\\ngiven us some brief foretastes.\\n\\nDistant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the\\nwhole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land\\nof Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the\\nlow midnight sun.\\n\\nOn cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying, owing to the\\ntendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent\\nvoid with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.\\n\\nAt length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five\\nhundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing\\na fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller\\ncontinental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological\\nspecimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.\\n\\nOur health so far had remained excellent--lime juice well offsetting\\nthe steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally\\nabove zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs.\\n\\nIt was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to\\nconclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long\\nantarctic night. Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the\\nwest, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising\\nrudimentary aëroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and\\nin reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck\\nand efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.\\n\\nThe outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also\\nof Lake\\'s strange and dogged insistence on a westward--or rather,\\nnorthwestward--prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new\\nbase.\\n\\nIt seems that he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical\\ndaring over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into\\nit certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted\\nhis curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings\\nand blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed\\nfragments evidently belonged.\\n\\nHe was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some\\nbulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably\\nadvanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of\\nso vastly ancient a date--Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian--as to\\npreclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life,\\nbut of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite\\nstage. These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five\\nhundred million to a thousand million years old.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  II.\\n\\n\\nPopular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless\\nbulletins of Lake\\'s start northwestward into regions never trodden\\nby human foot or penetrated by human imagination, though we did not\\nmention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of\\nbiology and geology.\\n\\nHis preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th\\nwith Pabodie and five others--marred by the loss of two dogs in an\\nupset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the ice--had\\nbrought up more and more of the Archæan slate; and even I was\\ninterested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that\\nunbelievably ancient stratum.\\n\\nThese markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving\\nno great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as\\ndefinitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to\\nsee the good sense of Lake\\'s demand for an interlude in our time-saving\\nprogram--an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men,\\nand the whole of the expedition\\'s mechanical apparatus.\\n\\nI did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany\\nthe northwestward party despite Lake\\'s plea for my geological advice.\\nWhile they were gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five\\nmen and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for\\nthis transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline\\nsupply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept\\nwith me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time\\nwithout possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of\\næon-long death.\\n\\nLake\\'s subexpedition into the unknown, as every one will recall, sent\\nout its own reports from the short-wave transmitters on the planes;\\nthese being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern\\nbase and by the _Arkham_ at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to\\nthe outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.\\n\\nThe start was made January 22nd at 4 a.m.; and the first wireless\\nmessage we received came only two hours later, when Lake spoke of\\ndescending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point\\nsome three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second\\nand very excited message told of the frantic, beaverlike work whereby a\\nshallow shaft had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery\\nof slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one\\nwhich had caused the original puzzlement.\\n\\nThree hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the\\nflight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched\\na message of protest against further hazards, Lake replied curtly that\\nhis new specimens made any hazard worth taking.\\n\\nI saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I\\ncould do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition\\'s\\nsuccess; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and\\ndeeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests\\nand unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some fifteen hundred\\nmiles to the half-known, half-suspected coast line of Queen Mary and\\nKnox Lands.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThen, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited\\nmessage from Lake\\'s moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments\\nand made me wish I had accompanied the party:\\n\\n    \"10:05 p.m. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range\\n    ahead higher than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing\\n    for height of plateau. Probable Latitude 76° 15´, Longitude 113° 10´\\n    E. Reaches far as can see to right and left. Suspicion of two\\n    smoking cones. All peaks black and bare of snow. Gale blowing off\\n    them impedes navigation.\"\\n\\nAfter that Pabodie, the men, and I hung breathlessly over the receiver.\\nThought of this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away\\ninflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our\\nexpedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In\\nhalf an hour Lake called us again:\\n\\n    \"Moulton\\'s plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody\\n    hurt and perhaps can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other\\n    three for return or further moves if necessary, but no more heavy\\n    plane travel needed just now. Mountains surpass anything in\\n    imagination. Am going up scouting in Carroll\\'s plane, with all\\n    weight out.\\n\\n    \"You can\\'t imagine anything like this. Highest peaks must go over\\n    thirty-five thousand feet. Everest out of the running, Atwood to\\n    work out height with theodolite while Carroll and I go up. Probably\\n    wrong about cones, for formations look stratified. Possibly\\n    pre-Cambrian slate with other strata mixed in. Queer sky line\\n    effects--regular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks. Whole\\n    thing marvelous in red-gold light of low sun. Like land of mystery\\n    in a dream or gateway to forbidden world of untrodden wonder. Wish\\n    you were here to study.\"\\n\\nThough it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners\\nthought for a moment of retiring. It must have been a good deal\\nthe same at McMurdo Sound, where the supply cache and the _Arkham_\\nwere also getting the messages; for Captain Douglas gave out a call\\ncongratulating everybody on the important find, and Sherman, the cache\\noperator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of course, about the\\ndamaged aëroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. Then, at eleven\\np.m., came another call from Lake:\\n\\n    \"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don\\'t dare try really tall\\n    peaks in present weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing,\\n    and hard going at this altitude, but worth it. Great range fairly\\n    solid, hence can\\'t get any glimpses beyond. Main summits exceed\\n    Himalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian slate,\\n    with plain signs of many other upheaved strata. Was wrong about\\n    volcanism. Goes farther in either direction than we can see. Swept\\n    clear of snow above about twenty-one thousand feet.\\n\\n    \"Odd formations on slopes of highest mountains. Great low square\\n    blocks with exactly vertical sides, and rectangular lines of low,\\n    vertical ramparts, like the old Asian castles clinging to steep\\n    mountains in Roerich\\'s paintings. Impressive from distance. Flew\\n    close to some, and Carroll thought they were formed of smaller\\n    separate pieces, but that is probably weathering. Most edges\\n    crumbled and rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate\\n    changes for millions of years.\\n\\n    \"Parts, especially upper parts, seem to be of lighter-colored\\n    rock than any visible strata on slopes proper, hence an evidently\\n    crystalline origin. Close flying shows many cave mouths, some\\n    unusually regular in outline, square or semicircular. You must come\\n    and investigate. Think I saw rampart squarely on top of one peak.\\n    Height seems about thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet. Am\\n    up twenty-one thousand five hundred myself, in devilish, gnawing\\n    cold. Wind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of\\n    caves, but no flying danger so far.\"\\n\\nFrom then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of\\ncomment, and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on\\nfoot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,\\nand that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline plan--just\\nwhere and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expedition\\'s\\naltered character.\\n\\nObviously, Lake\\'s boring operations, as well as his aëroplane\\nactivities, would need a great deal delivered at the new base which\\nhe was to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it was possible\\nthat the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In\\nconnection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to\\nget as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the\\nsingle dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown\\nregion between Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to\\nestablish.\\n\\nLake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay\\nwhere Moulton\\'s plane had been forced down, and where repairs had\\nalready progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with dark\\nground here and there visible, and he would sink some borings and\\nblasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing\\nexpeditions.\\n\\nHe spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the queer\\nstate of his sensations at being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles,\\nwhose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world\\'s rim.\\n\\n[Illustration: _It was a queer state of sensations--being in the lee of\\nvast, silent pinnacles, where ranks shot up like a wall reaching the\\nsky at the world\\'s rim._]\\n\\nAtwood\\'s theodolite observations had placed the height of the five\\ntallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet.\\n\\nThe windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it\\nargued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond\\nanything we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than\\nfive miles from where the higher foothills rose abruptly.\\n\\nI could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his words--flashed\\nacross a glacial void of seven hundred miles--as he urged that we all\\nhasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as\\nsoon as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day\\'s\\nwork of almost unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIn the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and\\nCaptain Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one\\nof Lake\\'s planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and\\nmyself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of the\\nfuel question, depending on our decision about an easterly trip, could\\nwait for a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp heat and\\nborings.\\n\\nEventually the old southern base ought to be restocked, but if we\\npostponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer,\\nand, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route\\nbetween his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.\\n\\nPabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as\\nthe case might be. If we wintered in the antarctic we would probably\\nfly straight from Lake\\'s base to the _Arkham_ without returning to\\nthis spot. Some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by\\nblocks of hard snow, and now we decided to complete the job of making a\\npermanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had with\\nhim all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed\\nthat Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after one\\nday\\'s work and one night\\'s rest.\\n\\nOur labors, however, were not very steady after four p.m., for about\\nthat time Lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited\\nmessages. His working day had started unpropitiously, since an\\naëroplane survey of the nearly exposed rock surfaces showed an entire\\nabsence of those Archæan and primordial strata for which he was\\nlooking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that\\nloomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp.\\n\\nMost of the rocks glimpsed were apparently Jurassic and Comanchean\\nsandstones and Permian and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy\\nblack outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal.\\n\\nThis rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on unearthing\\nspecimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear\\nto him that in order to recover the Archæan slate vein in which he\\nhad found the odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip\\nfrom these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains\\nthemselves.\\n\\nHe had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the\\nexpedition\\'s general program; hence, he set up the drill and put five\\nmen to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and\\nrepairing the damaged aëroplane. The softest visible rock--a sandstone\\nabout a quarter of a mile from the camp--had been chosen for the\\nfirst sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much\\nsupplementary blasting.\\n\\nIt was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy\\nblast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard;\\nand that young Gedney--the acting foreman--rushed into the camp with\\nthe startling news.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThey had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given\\nplace to a vein of Comanchean limestone, full of minute fossil\\ncephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional\\nsuggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones--the\\nlatter probably of teliosts, sharks, and ganoids.\\n\\nThis, in itself, was important enough, as affording the first\\nvertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured; but when shortly\\nafterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent\\nvacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread\\namong the excavators.\\n\\nA good-sized blast had laid open the subterrane secret; and now,\\nthrough a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet\\nthick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow\\nlimestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the\\ntrickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world.\\n\\nThe hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep, but\\nextended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly\\nmoving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean\\nsystem. Its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large\\nstalactites and stalagmites, some of which met in columnar form.\\n\\nBut important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones,\\nwhich in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown\\njungles of Mesozoic tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary\\ncycads, fan palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous medley\\ncontained representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other\\nanimal species than the greatest palæontologist could have counted or\\nclassified in a year. Mollusks, crustacean armor, fishes, amphibians,\\nreptiles, birds, and early mammals--great and small, known and unknown.\\n\\nNo wonder Gedney ran back to the camp shouting, and no wonder every one\\nelse dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where\\nthe tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to secrets of inner earth\\nand vanished æons.\\n\\nWhen Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity he\\nscribbled a message in his notebook and had young Moulton run back to\\nthe camp to dispatch it by wireless.\\n\\nThis was my first word of the discovery, and it told of the\\nidentification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms,\\nremnants of labyrinthodonta and thecoiidea, great mosasaur skull\\nfragments, dinosaur vertebræ and armor plates, pterodactyl teeth and\\nwing bones, Archaeopteryx débris, Miocene sharks\\' teeth, primitive\\nbird skulls, and other bones of archaic mammals such as Palæotheres,\\nXiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and Titanotheriidæ.\\n\\nThere was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer,\\nor bovine animal; hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had\\noccurred during the Oligocene Age, and that the hollowed stratum had\\nlain in its present dried, dead, and inaccessible state for at least\\nthirty million years.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular\\nin the highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the\\nevidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively\\nand unmistakably Comanchean and not a particle earlier; the free\\nfragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from\\norganisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periods--even\\nrudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as the Silurian or\\nOrdovician.\\n\\nThe inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had\\nbeen a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of\\nover three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million\\nyears ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene\\nAge when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation.\\n\\nIn any event, the coming of the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some\\nfive hundred thousand years ago--a mere yesterday as compared with the\\nage of this cavity--must have put an end to any of the primal forms\\nwhich had locally managed to outlive their common terms.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nLake was not content to let his first message stand, but had another\\nbulletin written and dispatched across the snow to the camp before\\nMoulton could get back. After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in\\none of the planes, transmitting to me--and to the _Arkham_ for relaying\\nto the outside world--the frequent postscripts which Lake sent him by a\\nsuccession of messengers.\\n\\nThose who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created\\namong men of science by that afternoon\\'s reports--reports which have\\nfinally led, after all these years, to the organization of that very\\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition which I am so anxious to dissuade from\\nits purposes. I had better give the messages literally as Lake sent\\nthem, and as our base operator McTighe translated them from his pencil\\nshorthand:\\n\\n    Fowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and\\n    limestone fragments from blasts. Several distinct triangular\\n    striated prints like those in archæan slate, proving that source\\n    survived from over six hundred million years ago to Comanchean\\n    times without more than moderate morphological changes and decrease\\n    in average size. Comanchean prints apparently more primitive or\\n    decadent, if anything, than older ones. Emphasize importance of\\n    discovery in press. Will mean to biology what Einstein has meant\\n    to mathematics and physics. Joins up with my previous work and\\n    amplifies conclusions.\\n\\n    Appears to indicate, as I suspected, that earth has seen whole cycle\\n    or cycles of organic life before known one that begins with\\n    Archæozoic cells. Was evolved and specialized not later than a\\n    thousand million years ago, when planet was young and recently\\n    uninhabitable for any life forms of normal protoplasmic structure.\\n    Question arises when, where, and how development took place.\\n\\n        *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n    Later. Examining certain skeletal fragments of large land and marine\\n    saurians and primitive mammals, find singular local wounds or\\n    injuries to bony structure not attributable to any known predatory\\n    or carnivorous animal of any period. Of two sorts--straight,\\n    penetrant bores, and apparently hacking incisions. One or two\\n    cases of cleanly severed bones. Not many specimens affected. Am\\n    sending to camp for electric torches. Will extend search area\\n    underground by hacking away stalactites.\\n\\n        *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n    Still later. Have found peculiar soapstone fragment about six inches\\n    across and an inch and a half thick, wholly unlike any visible local\\n    formation--greenish, but no evidences to place its period. Has\\n    curious smoothness and regularity. Shaped like five-pointed star\\n    with tips broken off, and signs of other cleavage at inward angles\\n    and in center of surface. Small, smooth depression in center of\\n    unbroken surface. Arouses much curiosity as to source and\\n    weathering. Probably some freak of water action. Carroll, with\\n    magnifier, thinks he can make out additional markings of geologic\\n    significance. Groups of tiny dots in regular patterns. Dogs growing\\n    uneasy as we work, and seem to hate this soapstone. Must see if it\\n    has any peculiar odor. Will report again when Mills gets back with\\n    light and we start on underground area.\\n\\n        *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n    10:15 p.m. Important discovery. Orrendorf and Watkins, working\\n    underground at 9:45 with light, found monstrous barrel-shaped fossil\\n    of wholly unknown nature; probably vegetable unless overgrown\\n    specimen of unknown marine radiata. Tissue evidently preserved by\\n    mineral salts. Tough as leather, but astonishing flexibility\\n    retained in places. Marks of broken-off parts at ends and around\\n    sides. Six feet end to end, three and five tenths feet central\\n    diameter, tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five\\n    bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of\\n    thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In\\n    furrows between ridges are curious growths--combs or wings that\\n    fold up and spread out like fans. All greatly damaged but one,\\n    which gives almost seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one\\n    of certain monsters of primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things\\n    in _Necronomicon_.\\n\\n    These wings seem to be membranous, stretched on framework of\\n    glandular tubing. Apparent minute orifices in frame tubing at wing\\n    tips. Ends of body shriveled, giving no clue to interior or to what\\n    has been broken off there. Must dissect when we get back to camp.\\n    Can\\'t decide whether vegetable or animal. Many features obviously\\n    of almost incredible primitiveness. Have set all hands cutting\\n    stalactites and looking for further specimens. Additional scarred\\n    bones found, but these must wait. Having trouble with dogs. They\\n    can\\'t endure the new specimen, and would probably tear it to pieces\\n    if we didn\\'t keep it at a distance from them.\\n\\n        *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n    11:30 p.m. Attention, Dyer, Pabodie, Douglas. Matter of highest--I\\n    might say transcendent--importance. _Arkham_ must relay to Kingsport\\n    Head Station at once. Strange barrel growth is the archæan thing\\n    that left prints in rocks. Mills, Boudreau, and Fowler discover\\n    cluster of thirteen more at underground point forty feet from\\n    aperture. Mixed with curiously rounded and configured soapstone\\n    fragments smaller than one previously found--star-shaped, but no\\n    marks of breakage except at some of the points.\\n\\n    Of organic specimens, eight apparently perfect, with all appendages.\\n    Have brought all to surface, leading off dogs to distance. They\\n    cannot stand the things. Give close attention to description and\\n    repeat back for accuracy. Papers must get this right.\\n\\n    Objects are eight feet long all over. Six-foot, five-ridged barrel\\n    torso three and five tenths feet central diameter, one foot end\\n    diameters. Dark gray, flexible, and infinitely tough. Seven-foot\\n    membranous wings of same color, found folded, spread out of furrows\\n    between ridges. Wing framework tubular or glandular, or lighter\\n    gray, with orifices at wing tips. Spread wings have serrated edge.\\n    Around equator, one at central apex of each of the five vertical,\\n    stavelike ridges, are five systems of light-gray flexible arms or\\n    tentacles found tightly folded to torso but expansible to maximum\\n    length of over three feet. Like arms of primitive crinoid. Single\\n    stalks three inches diameter branch after six inches into five\\n    substalks, each of which branches after eight inches into five\\n    small, tapering tentacles or tendrils, giving each stalk a total\\n    of twenty-five tentacles.\\n\\n    At top of torso blunt, bulbous neck of lighter gray, with gill-like\\n    suggestions, holds yellowish five-pointed starfish-shaped apparent\\n    head covered with three-inch wiry cilia of various prismatic colors.\\n\\n    Head thick and puffy, about two feet point to point, with three-inch\\n    flexible yellowish tubes projecting from each point. Slit in exact\\n    center of top probably breathing aperture. At end of each tube is\\n    spherical expansion where yellowish membrane rolls back on handling\\n    to reveal glassy, red-irised globe, evidently an eye.\\n\\n    Five slightly longer reddish tubes start from inner angles of\\n    starfish-shaped head and end in saclike swellings of same color\\n    which, upon pressure, open to bell-shaped orifices two inches\\n    maximum  diameter and lined with sharp, white tooth-like\\n    projections--probable mouths. All these tubes, cilia, and points\\n    of starfish head, found folded tightly down; tubes and points\\n    clinging to bulbous neck and  torso. Flexibility surprising despite\\n    vast toughness.\\n\\n    At bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts\\n    of head arrangements exist. Bulbous light-gray pseudoneck, without\\n    gill suggestions, holds greenish five-pointed starfish arrangement.\\n\\n    Tough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches\\n    diameter at base to about two and five tenths at point. To each\\n    point is attached small end of a greenish five-veined membranous\\n    triangle eight inches long and six wide at farther end. This is the\\n    paddle, fin, or pseudofoot which had made prints in rocks from a\\n    thousand million to fifty or sixty million years old.\\n\\n    From inner angles of starfish arrangement project two-foot reddish\\n    tubes tapering from three inches diameter at base to one at tip.\\n    Orifices at tips. All these parts infinitely tough and leathery,\\n    but extremely flexible. Four-foot arms with paddles undoubtedly\\n    used for locomotion of some sort, marine or otherwise. When moved,\\n    display suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As found, all\\n    these projections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso,\\n    corresponding to projections at other end.\\n\\n    Cannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but\\n    odds now favor animal. Probably represents incredibly advanced\\n    evolution of radiata without loss of certain primitive features.\\n    Echinoderm resemblances unmistakable despite local contradictory\\n    evidences.\\n\\n    Wing structure puzzles in view of probable marine habitat, but may\\n    have use in water navigation. Symmetry is curiously vegetablelike,\\n    suggesting vegetable\\'s essential up-and-down structure rather than\\n    animal\\'s fore-and-aft structure. Fabulously early date of evolution,\\n    preceding even simplest archæan Protozoa hitherto known, baffles all\\n    conjecture as to origin.\\n\\n    Complete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain\\n    creatures of primal myth that suggestion of ancient existence\\n    outside antarctic becomes inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read\\n    _Necronomicon_ and seen Clark Ashton Smith\\'s nightmare paintings\\n    based on text, and will understand when I speak of Elder Things\\n    supposed to have created all earth life as jest or mistake. Students\\n    have always thought conception formed from morbid imaginative\\n    treatment of very ancient tropical radiata. Also like prehistoric\\n    folklore things Wilmarth has spoken of--Cthulhu cult appendages,\\n    etc.\\n\\n    Vast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous\\n    or early Eocene period, judging from associated specimens. Massive\\n    stalagmites deposited above them. Hard work hewing out, but\\n    toughness prevented damage. State of preservation miraculous,\\n    evidently owing to limestone action. No more found so far, but\\n    will resume search later. Job now to get fourteen huge specimens\\n    to camp without dogs, which bark furiously and can\\'t be trusted\\n    near them.\\n\\n    With nine men--three left to guard the dogs--we ought to manage the\\n    three sledges fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane\\n    communication with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But\\n    I\\'ve got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest.\\n    Wish I had a real laboratory here. Dyer better kick himself for\\n    having tried to stop my westward trip. First the world\\'s greatest\\n    mountains, and then this. If this last isn\\'t the high spot of the\\n    expedition, I don\\'t know what is. We\\'re made scientifically.\\n    Congrats, Pabodie, on the drill that opened up the cave. Now will\\n    _Arkham_ please repeat description?\\n\\n[Illustration: \"_I\\'ve got to dissect one of these things before_----\"\\n\\n\"_First the world\\'s greatest mountains--then this!_\"]\\n\\nThe sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were\\nalmost beyond description, nor were our companions much behind us in\\nenthusiasm. McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high spots as\\nthey came from the droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message\\nfrom his shorthand version, as soon as Lake\\'s operator signed off.\\n\\nAll appreciated the epoch-making significance of the discovery, and\\nI sent Lake congratulations as soon as the _Arkham\\'s_ operator had\\nrepeated back the descriptive parts as requested; and my example was\\nfollowed by Sherman from his station at the McMurdo Sound supply cache,\\nas well as by Captain Douglas of the _Arkham_.\\n\\nLater, as head of the expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed\\nthrough the _Arkham_ to the outside world. Of course, rest was an\\nabsurd thought amidst this excitement; and my only wish was to get to\\nLake\\'s camp as quickly as I could. It disappointed me when he sent word\\nthat a rising mountain gale made early aërial travel impossible.\\n\\nBut within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish\\ndisappointment. Lake, sending more messages, told of the completely\\nsuccessful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp.\\nIt had been a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly heavy; but\\nnine men had accomplished it very neatly. Now some of the party were\\nhurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp, to\\nwhich the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The\\nspecimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp, save for one on\\nwhich Lake was making crude attempts at dissection.\\n\\nThis dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected,\\nfor, despite the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised\\nlaboratory tent, the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen\\nspecimen--a powerful and intact one--lost nothing of their more than\\nleathery toughness. Lake was puzzled as to how he might make the\\nrequisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all\\nthe structural niceties he was looking for.\\n\\nHe had, it is true, seven more perfect specimens; but these were too\\nfew to use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited\\nsupply. Accordingly, he removed the specimen and dragged in one which,\\nthough having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both ends, was\\nbadly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows.\\n\\nResults, quickly reported over the wireless, were baffling and\\nprovocative indeed. Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with\\ninstruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little\\nthat was achieved left us all awed and bewildered.\\n\\nExisting biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no\\nproduct of any cell growth science knows about. There had been scarcely\\nany mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million\\nyears the internal organs were wholly intact.\\n\\nThe leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an\\ninherent attribute of the thing\\'s form of organization, and pertained\\nto some paleocene cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our\\npowers of speculation.\\n\\nAt first all that Lake found was dry, but as the heated tent produced\\nits thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent and offensive odor\\nwas encountered toward the thing\\'s uninjured side. It was not blood,\\nbut a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose.\\nBy the time Lake reached this stage all thirty-seven dogs had been\\nbrought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp, and even at that\\ndistance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid,\\ndiffusive smell.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFar from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional\\ndissection merely deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external\\nmembers had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly\\nhesitate to call the thing animal, but internal inspection brought up\\nso many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It\\nhad digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the\\nreddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base.\\n\\nCursorily, one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen\\nrather than carbon dioxide; and there were odd evidences of air-storage\\nchambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice\\nto at least two other fully developed breathing systems--gills and\\npores.\\n\\nClearly, it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless\\nhibernation periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connection\\nwith the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies beyond\\nimmediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable\\nutterance, seemed barely conceivable, but musical piping notes covering\\na wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost\\npre-naturally developed.\\n\\nThe nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake\\naghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the\\nthing had a set of gangliar centers and connectives arguing the very\\nextremes of specialized development.\\n\\nIts five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced, and there were signs of\\na sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head,\\ninvolving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism. Probably it\\nhad more than five senses, so that its habits could not be predicted\\nfrom any existing analogy.\\n\\nIt must, Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and\\ndelicately differentiated functions in its primal world--much like the\\nants and bees of to-day. It reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams,\\nespecially the pteridophyta; having spore cases at the tips of the\\nwings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallus.\\n\\nBut to give it a name at this stage was mere folly. It looked like a\\nradiate, but was clearly something more. It was partly vegetable, but\\nhad three fourths of the essentials of animal structure. That it was\\nmarine in origin, its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes\\nclearly indicated; yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its\\nlater adaptations.\\n\\nThe wings, after all, held a persistent suggestion of the aërial.\\nHow it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a\\nnew-born earth in time to leave prints in archæan rocks was so far\\nbeyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the primal myths\\nabout Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted\\nearth life as a joke or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill\\nthings from outside told by a folklorist colleague in Miskatonic\\'s\\nEnglish department.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNaturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints\\nhaving been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens,\\nbut quickly rejected this too-facile theory upon considering the\\nadvanced structural qualities of the older fossils. If anything, the\\nlater contours showed decadence rather than higher evolution.\\n\\nThe size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology\\nseemed coarsened and simplified. Moreover, the nerves and organs,\\njust examined, held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms\\nstill more complex. Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly\\nprevalent. Altogether, little could be said to have been solved; and\\nLake fell back on mythology for a provisional name--jocosely dubbing\\nhis finds \"The Elder Ones.\"\\n\\nAt about two-thirty a.m., having decided to postpone further work and\\nget a little rest, he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin,\\nemerged from the laboratory tent, and studied the intact specimens with\\nrenewed interest.\\n\\nThe ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a\\ntrifle, so that the head points and tubes of two or three showed\\nsigns of unfolding; but Lake did not believe there was any danger of\\nimmediate decomposition in the almost subzero air. He did, however,\\nmove all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare\\ntent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That\\nwould also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs,\\nwhose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem, even at their\\nsubstantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls, which\\nan increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their\\nquarters.\\n\\nHe had to weight down the corners of the tent cloth with heavy blocks\\nof snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, for the titan\\nmountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early\\napprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under\\nAtwood\\'s supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog\\ncorral, and crude aëroplane shelters with snow, on the mountainward\\nside. These latter shelters, begun with hard snow blocks during odd\\nmoments, were by no means as high as they should have been; and Lake\\nfinally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.\\n\\nIt was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised\\nus all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter\\nwalls were a little higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie\\nover the ether, and repeated his praise of the really marvelous drills\\nthat had helped him make his discovery. Atwood also sent greetings and\\npraises.\\n\\nI gave Lake a warm word of congratulation, owning up that he was right\\nabout the western trip, and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless\\nat ten in the morning. If the gale was then over, Lake would send a\\nplane for the party at my base. Just before retiring I dispatched a\\nfinal message to the _Arkham_, with instructions about toning down the\\nday\\'s news for the outside world, since the full details seemed radical\\nenough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 III.\\n\\n\\nNone of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning.\\nBoth the excitement of Lake\\'s discovery and the mounting fury of the\\nwind were against such a thing. So savage was the blast even where we\\nwere, that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at Lake\\'s\\ncamp, directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it.\\n\\nMcTighe was awake at ten o\\'clock and tried to get Lake on the wireless,\\nas agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the\\nwestward seemed to prevent communication. We did, however, get the\\n_Arkham_, and Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying\\nto reach Lake. He had not known about the wind, for very little was\\nblowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.\\n\\nThroughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at\\nintervals, but invariably without results. About noon a positive frenzy\\nof wind stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of\\nour camp; but it eventually died down, with only a moderate relapse at\\ntwo p.m.\\n\\nAfter three o\\'clock it was very quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to\\nget Lake. Reflecting that he had four planes, each provided with an\\nexcellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine any ordinary accident\\ncapable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once. Nevertheless,\\nthe stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious force\\nthe wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the\\nmost direful conjectures.\\n\\nBy six o\\'clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a\\nwireless consultation with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take\\nsteps toward investigation. The fifth aëroplane, which we had left\\nat the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was\\nin good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that the very\\nemergency for which it had been saved was now upon us.\\n\\nI got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane\\nand the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible, the\\nair conditions being apparently highly favorable. We then talked over\\nthe personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that we\\nwould include all hands, together with the sledge and dogs which I\\nhad kept with me. Even so great a load would not be too much for one\\nof the huge planes built to our special orders for heavy machinery\\ntransportation. At intervals I still tried to reach Lake with the\\nwireless, but all to no purpose.\\n\\nSherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at seven\\nthirty; and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing.\\nThey arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed\\nthe next move. It was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a\\nsingle aëroplane without any line of bases, but no one drew back from\\nwhat seemed like the plainest necessity. We turned in at two o\\'clock\\nfor a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were\\nup again in four hours to finish the loading and packing.\\n\\nAt seven fifteen a.m., January 25th, we started northwestward under\\nMcTighe\\'s pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food\\nsupply, and other items including the plane\\'s wireless outfit. The\\natmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and relatively mild in temperature,\\nand we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and\\nlongitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp. Our apprehensions\\nwere over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of our\\njourney, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the\\ncamp.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nEvery incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my\\nrecollection because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my\\nloss, at the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the\\nnormal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external\\nnature and nature\\'s laws.\\n\\nThenceforward the ten of us--but the student Danforth and myself\\nabove all others--were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking\\nhorrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we\\nwould refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could. The\\nnewspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane,\\ntelling of our nonstop course, our two battles with treacherous\\nupper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk\\nhis mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of\\nthose strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as\\nrolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau.\\n\\nThere came a point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed\\nin any words the press would understand, and a later point when we had\\nto adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.\\n\\nThe sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones\\nand pinnacles ahead, and his shouts sent every one to the windows of\\nthe great cabined plane. Despite our speed, they were very slow in\\ngaining prominence; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off,\\nand visible only because of their abnormal height.\\n\\nLittle by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky,\\nallowing us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and\\nto catch the curious sense of phantasy which they inspired as seen\\nin the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of\\niridescent ice-dust clouds.\\n\\nIn the whole spectacle there was a persistent, pervasive hint of\\nstupendous secrecy and potential revelation. It was as if these\\nstark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into\\nforbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space,\\nand ultradimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil\\nthings--mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some\\naccursed ultimate abyss.\\n\\nThat seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable\\nsuggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially\\nspatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness,\\nseparateness, desolation, and æon-long death of this untrodden and\\nunfathomed austral world.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities\\nof the higher mountain sky line--regularities like clinging fragments\\nof perfect cubes, which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which\\nindeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of\\nprimordial temple ruins, on cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and\\nstrangely painted by Roerich.\\n\\nThere was indeed something hauntingly Roerichlike about this whole\\nunearthly continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in October\\nwhen we first caught sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now.\\nI felt, too, another wave of uneasy consciousness of archæan mythical\\nresemblances, of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the\\nevilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal writings.\\n\\nMythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia, but the racial memory of\\nman--or of his predecessors--is long, and it may well be that certain\\ntales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror\\nearlier than Asia and earlier than any human world we know.\\n\\nA few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the\\nfragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees\\nof Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as Tsathoggua itself.\\n\\nLeng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a region I\\nwould care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a\\nworld that had ever bred such ambiguous and archæan monstrosities as\\nthose Lake had just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had\\never read the abhorred _Necronomicon_, or talked so much with that\\nunpleasantly erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre\\nmirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith\\nas we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative\\nundulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during\\nthe preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically\\nvivid as the present sample, but this one had a wholly novel and\\nobscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething\\nlabyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the\\ntroubled ice vapors above our heads.\\n\\nThe effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to\\nman or to human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black\\nmasonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws. There\\nwere truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by\\ntall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often\\ncapped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks, and strange, beetling,\\ntablelike constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular\\nslabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one\\noverlapping the one beneath.\\n\\nThere were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting\\ncylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and\\noccasional needlelike spires in curious clusters of five.\\n\\nAll of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges\\ncrossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the\\nimplied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer\\ngiganticism.\\n\\nThe general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms\\nobserved and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820, but at\\nthis time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks soaring\\nstupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our minds,\\nand the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our\\nexpedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and\\ninfinitely evil portent.\\n\\nI was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process\\nthe various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary\\nforms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to\\nchurning opalescence, we began to look earthward again, and saw that\\nour journey\\'s end was not far off.\\n\\nThe unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of\\ngiants, their curious regularities showing with startling clearness\\neven without a field glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and\\ncould see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau\\na couple of darkish spots which we took to be Lake\\'s camp and boring.\\n\\nThe higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming a\\nrange almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan\\npeaks beyond them. At length Ropes--the student who had relieved\\nMcTighe at the controls--began to head downward toward the left-hand\\ndark spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent\\nout the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from\\nour expedition.\\n\\nEvery one, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of\\nthe rest of our antarctic sojourn.\\n\\nSome hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we\\nfound, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party\\nby the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before\\nthat. There were eleven known dead, young Gedney was missing.\\n\\nPeople pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the\\nshock the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we\\nexplained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven\\nbodies unsuitable for transportation outside.\\n\\nIndeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter\\nbewilderment, and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the\\ntruth in any specific instance. The tremendous significance lies in\\nwhat we dared not tell; what I would not tell now but for the need of\\nwarning others off from nameless terrors.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt is a fact that the wind had wrought dreadful havoc. Whether all\\ncould have lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely\\nopen to doubt. The storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles,\\nmust have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before.\\n\\nOne aëroplane shelter--all, it seems, had been left in a far too flimsy\\nand inadequate state--was nearly pulverized; and the derrick at the\\ndistant boring was entirely shaken to pieces.\\n\\nThe exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was\\nbruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened\\ndespite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blast were\\npitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were\\ncompletely obliterated.\\n\\nIt is also true that we found none of the archæan biological objects in\\na condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals\\nfrom a vast, tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone\\nfragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped\\ndots caused so many doubtful comparisons, and some fossil bones, among\\nwhich were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens.\\n\\nNone of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near\\nthe camp being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that,\\nthough the greater breakage, on the side next to the camp, which was\\nnot the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic\\nbeasts themselves.\\n\\nAll three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind\\nmay have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting\\nmachinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so\\nwe used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past\\nwhich Lake had blasted.\\n\\nWe likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes;\\nsince our surviving party had only four real pilots--Sherman, Danforth,\\nMcTighe, and Ropes--in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to\\nnavigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and\\nother incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably\\nblown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of\\ncondition.\\n\\nIt was approximately four p.m., after wide plane cruising had forced\\nus to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the\\n_Arkham_ for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and\\nnoncommittal as we succeeded in doing.\\n\\nThe most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic\\nuneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor\\nLake\\'s accounts. We did not mention, I think, their display of the\\nsame uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones\\nand certain other objects in the disordered region--objects including\\nscientific instruments, aëroplanes, and machinery, both at the camp\\nand at the boring, whose parts had been loosened, moved, or otherwise\\ntampered with by winds that must have harbored singular curiosity and\\ninvestigativeness.\\n\\nAbout the fourteen biological specimens we were pardonably indefinite.\\nWe said that the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough\\nwas left of them to prove Lake\\'s description wholly and impressively\\naccurate. It was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this\\nmatter--and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found\\nthose which we did find. We had by that time agreed not to transmit\\nanything suggesting madness on the part of Lake\\'s men, and it surely\\nlooked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully\\nburied upright in nine-foot snow graves under five-pointed mounds\\npunched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly like those on\\nthe queer greenish soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times.\\nThe eight perfect specimens mentioned by Lake seemed to have been\\ncompletely blown away.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWe were careful, too, about the public\\'s general peace of mind; hence\\nDanforth and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains\\nthe next day. It was the fact that only a radically lightened plane\\ncould possibly cross a range of such height which mercifully limited\\nthat scouting tour to the two of us.\\n\\nOn our return at one a.m., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an\\nadmirably stiff upper lip. It took no persuasion to make him promise\\nnot to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our\\npockets, not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed\\nto relay outside, and to hide our camera films for private development\\nlater on; so that part of my present story will be as new to Pabodie,\\nMcTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to that world in\\ngeneral. Indeed--Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or\\nthinks he saw, one thing he will not tell even me.\\n\\nAs all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascent--a\\nconfirmation of Lake\\'s opinion that the great peaks are of archæan\\nslate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least\\nmiddle Comanchean time, a conventional comment on the regularity of the\\nclinging cube and rampart formations, a decision that the cave mouths\\nindicate dissolved calcareous veins, a conjecture that certain slopes\\nand passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range\\nby seasoned mountaineers, and a remark that the mysterious other side\\nholds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the\\nmountains themselves--twenty thousand feet in elevation, with grotesque\\nrock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low\\ngradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer\\nprecipices of the highest peaks.\\n\\nThis body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and\\nit completely satisfied the men at the camp. We laid our absence of\\nsixteen hours--a longer time than our announced flying, landing,\\nreconnoitering, and rock-collecting program called for--to a long\\nmythical spell of adverse wind conditions, and told truly of our\\nlanding on the farther foothills.\\n\\nFortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt\\nany of the others into emulating our flight. Had any tried to do that,\\nI would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop them--and I do\\nnot know what Danforth would have done.\\n\\nWhile we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson\\nhad worked like beavers over Lake\\'s two best planes, fitting them\\nagain for use, despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their\\noperative mechanism.\\n\\nWe decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for\\nour old base as soon as possible. Even though indirect, that was the\\nsafest way to work toward McMurdo Sound; for a straight-line flight\\nacross the most utterly unknown stretches of the æon-dead continent\\nwould involve many additional hazards.\\n\\nFurther exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic\\ndecimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery. The doubts and\\nhorrors around us--which we did not reveal--made us wish only to escape\\nfrom this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly\\nas we could.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without\\nfurther disasters. All planes reached the old base on the evening of\\nthe next day--January 27th--after a swift nonstop flight; and on the\\n28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief,\\nand occasioned by a faulty rudder, in the furious wind over the ice\\nshelf after we had cleared the great plateau.\\n\\nIn five days more, the _Arkham_ and _Miskatonic_, with all hands and\\nequipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice\\nand working up Ross Sea, with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land\\nlooming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the\\nwind\\'s wails into a wide-ranged musical piping which chilled my soul to\\nthe quick.\\n\\nLess than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind\\nus and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted, accursed realm\\nwhere life and death, space and time, have made black and blasphemous\\nalliances in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on\\nthe planet\\'s scarce-cooled crust.\\n\\nSince our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic\\nexploration, and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with\\nsplendid unity and faithfulness. Even young Danforth, with his nervous\\nbreakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors.\\n\\nIndeed, as I have said, there is one thing he thinks he alone saw\\nwhich he will not tell even me, though I think it would help his\\npsychological state if he would consent to do so. It might explain and\\nrelieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive\\naftermath of an earlier shock. That is the impression I gather after\\nthose rare, irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to\\nme--things which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on\\nhimself again.\\n\\nIt will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and\\nsome of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring\\nnotice. We might have known from the first that human curiosity is\\nundying, and that the results we announced would be enough to spur\\nothers ahead on the same age-long pursuit of the unknown.\\n\\nLake\\'s reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused\\nnaturalists and palæontologists to the highest pitch, though we were\\nsensible enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the\\nactual buried specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as\\nthey were found. We also refrained from showing the more puzzling of\\nthe scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while Danforth and I have\\nclosely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across\\nthe range, and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and\\nbrought away in our pockets.\\n\\nBut now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a\\nthoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted--if not\\ndissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic\\nand melt and bore till they bring up that which we know may end the\\nworld. So I must break through all reticences at last--even about that\\nultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  IV.\\n\\n\\nIt is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go\\nback to Lake\\'s camp and what we really found there--and to that other\\nthing beyond the awful mountain wall.\\n\\nI have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the\\ndisarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing\\nsledges and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of\\nGedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely\\nsound in texture for all their structural injuries, from a world forty\\nmillion years dead. I do not recall whether I mentioned that upon\\nchecking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing. We did not\\nthink much about that till later--indeed, only Danforth and I have\\nthought of it at all.\\n\\nThe principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies,\\nand to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and\\nincredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos.\\n\\nAt the time, I tried to keep the men\\'s minds off those points; for\\nit was so much simpler--so much more normal--to lay everything to an\\noutbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake\\'s party. From the look\\nof things, that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive\\nany man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and\\ndesolation.\\n\\nThe crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the\\nbodies--men and dogs alike. They had all been in some terrible kind\\nof conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether\\ninexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case\\ncome from strangulation or laceration.\\n\\nThe dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their\\nill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within.\\nIt had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of\\nthe animals for those hellish archæan organisms, but the precaution\\nseemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that monstrous\\nwind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have\\nstampeded--whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle,\\nincreasing odor emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBut whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough.\\nPerhaps I had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at\\nlast--though with a categorical statement of opinion, based on the\\nfirst-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both Danforth and\\nmyself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the\\nloathsome horrors we found.\\n\\nI have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must\\nadd that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious,\\ncold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was the same with dogs and men.\\nAll the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or bipedal, had had\\ntheir most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a careful\\nbutcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt--taken from\\nthe ravaged provision chests on the planes--which conjured up the most\\nhorrible associations.\\n\\nThe thing had occurred in one of the crude aëroplane shelters from\\nwhich the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced\\nall tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered\\nbits of clothing, roughly slashed from the human incision subjects,\\nhinted no clues.\\n\\nIt is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint snow\\nprints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure--because that\\nimpression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly\\nmixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been\\ngiving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one\\'s\\nimagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.\\n\\nAs I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in\\nthe end. When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs\\nand two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered\\nafter investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal.\\n\\nIt was not as Lake had left it, for the covered parts of the primal\\nmonstrosity had been removed from the improvised table. Indeed, we had\\nalready realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried\\nthings we had found--the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful\\nodor--must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake\\nhad tried to analyze.\\n\\nOn and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it\\ndid not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully,\\nthough oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I\\nshall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man\\'s\\nidentity.\\n\\nLake\\'s anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences\\nof their careful cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though\\naround it we found a curious litter of matches. We buried the human\\nparts beside the other ten men, and the canine parts with the other\\nthirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory\\ntable, and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered\\nnear it, we were much too bewildered to speculate.\\n\\nThis formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were\\nequally perplexing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the\\neight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain\\ninstruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing\\nmaterials, electric torches and batteries, food and fuel, heating\\napparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond\\nsane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on\\ncertain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling\\nand experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices\\nboth at the camp and at the boring. The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly\\ndisordered machinery.\\n\\nThen, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance\\nof certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried\\nopen in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places. The\\nprofusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, formed\\nanother minor enigma--as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits\\nwhich we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings\\nconceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations.\\n\\nThe maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial\\nof the damaged archæan specimens, were all of a piece with this\\napparent disintegrative madness. In view of just such an eventuality\\nas the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences\\nof insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress\\nour pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather-Moore\\nExpedition.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOur first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph\\nand open the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds.\\nWe could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds,\\nwith their clusters of grouped dots, to poor Lake\\'s descriptions of the\\nstrange greenish soapstones; and when we came on some of the soapstones\\nthemselves in the great mineral pile we found the likeness very close\\nindeed.\\n\\nThe whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably\\nsuggestive of the starfish head of the archæan entities; and we agreed\\nthat the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitized minds\\nof Lake\\'s overwrought party.\\n\\nFor madness--centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving\\nagent--was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far\\nas spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so naïve as\\nto deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity\\nforbade him to formulate completely.\\n\\nSherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aëroplane cruise over\\nall the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon\\nwith field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing\\nthings; but nothing came to light.\\n\\nThe party reported that the titan-barrier range extended endlessly to\\nright and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential\\nstructure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart\\nformations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes\\nto Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave\\nmouths on the black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as\\nthe range could be traced.\\n\\nIn spite of all the prevailing horrors we were left with enough sheer\\nscientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm\\nbeyond those mysterious mountains.\\n\\nAs our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight after our day of\\nterror and bafflement--but not without a tentative plan for one or more\\nrange-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with aërial camera\\nand geologist\\'s outfit, beginning the following morning.\\n\\nIt was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at seven\\na.m. intending an early trip; though heavy winds--mentioned in our\\nbrief bulletin to the outside world--delayed our start till nearly nine\\no\\'clock.\\n\\nI have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at\\ncamp--and relayed outside--after our return sixteen hours later.\\nIt is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in\\nthe merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in that hidden\\ntransmontane world--hints of the revelations which have finally driven\\nDanforth to a nervous collapse.\\n\\nI wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks\\nhe alone saw--even though it was probably a nervous delusion--and which\\nwas perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm\\nagainst that. All I can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers\\nabout what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the\\nwind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which I\\nshared.\\n\\nThis will form my last word. If the plain signs of surviving elder\\nhorrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling\\nwith the inner antarctic--or at least from prying too deeply beneath\\nthe surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and unhuman,\\næon-cursed desolation--the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps\\nimmeasurable evils will not be mine.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nDanforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon\\nflight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest\\navailable pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within\\nsight of camp, and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand\\nfeet above sea-level. For this point, then, we first headed in the\\nlightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.\\n\\nThe camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental\\nplateau, was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the\\nactual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem.\\nNevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense\\ncold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had\\nto leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our\\nheaviest furs.\\n\\nAs we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the\\nline of crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more\\nand more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and\\nthought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich.\\n\\nThe ancient and wind-weathered rock strata fully verified all of\\nLake\\'s bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles had been towering\\nup in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth\\'s\\nhistory--perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had\\nonce been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange\\nregion pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to\\nchange, and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock\\ndisintegration.\\n\\nBut it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave\\nmouths which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a\\nfield glass and took aërial photographs while Danforth drove; and at\\ntimes I relieved him at the controls--though my aviation knowledge was\\npurely an amateur\\'s--in order to let him use the binoculars.\\n\\nWe could easily see that much of the material of the things was a\\nlightish archæan quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad\\nareas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and\\nuncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.\\n\\nAs he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold\\næons of savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough\\nmaterial had saved them from obliteration. Many parts, especially\\nthose closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the\\nsurrounding rock surface.\\n\\nThe whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in\\nthe Andes, or the primal foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the\\nOxford-Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I\\nobtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which\\nLake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll.\\n\\nHow to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and\\nI felt queerly humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have\\nstrange regularities--like the famous Giants\\' Causeway in Ireland--but\\nthis stupendous range, despite Lake\\'s original suspicion of smoking\\ncones, was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structure.\\n\\nThe curious cave mouths, near which the odd formation seemed most\\nabundant, presented another, albeit a lesser puzzle because of their\\nregularity of outline. They were, as Lake\\'s bulletin had said, often\\napproximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had\\nbeen shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand. Their numerousness\\nand wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole\\nregion was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata.\\n\\nSuch glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but\\nwe saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites.\\nOutside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures\\nseemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the\\nslight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual\\npatterns.\\n\\nFilled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the\\ncamp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling\\ngroups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so\\nhideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six\\nburied monstrosities.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWe had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along\\ntoward the relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we\\noccasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route,\\nwondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler\\nequipment of earlier days.\\n\\nSomewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult\\nas such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots\\nit would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a\\nShackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to\\nwind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen\\npass we found that its case formed no exception.\\n\\nOur sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest\\nand peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper;\\neven though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range\\nessentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch\\nof evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of\\nopalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and\\nattenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it\\nan affair of vague psychological symbolism and æsthetic association--a\\nthing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths\\nlurking in shunned and forbidden volumes.\\n\\nEven the wind\\'s burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity;\\nand for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre\\nmusical whistling, or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in\\nand out of the omnipresent and resonant cave mouths. There was a cloudy\\nnote of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable\\nas any of the other dark impressions.\\n\\nWe were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand\\nfive hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left\\nthe region of clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only\\ndark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers--but with\\nthose provocative cubes, ramparts, and echoing cave mouths to add a\\nportent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dreamlike.\\n\\nLooking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one\\nmentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be\\nhalf lost in a queer antarctic haze--such a haze, perhaps, as had been\\nresponsible for Lake\\'s early notion of volcanism.\\n\\nThe pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its\\njagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with\\nswirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun--the sky of that\\nmysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed.\\n\\nA few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth\\nand I, unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind\\nthat raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled\\nengines, exchanged eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last\\nfew feet, we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the\\nunsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  V.\\n\\n\\nI think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder,\\nterror, and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass\\nand saw what lay beyond. Of course, we must have had some natural\\ntheory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment.\\nProbably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones\\nof the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the fantastically symmetrical\\nwind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps we even half thought\\nthe sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first\\napproaching those mountains of madness.\\n\\nWe must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our\\neyes swept that limitless, tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the\\nalmost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically\\neurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests\\nabove a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its\\nthickest, and in places obviously thinner.\\n\\nThe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish\\nviolation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here,\\non a hellishly ancient table-land fully twenty thousand feet high,\\nand in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less\\nthan five hundred thousand years ago, there stretched nearly to the\\nvision\\'s limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of\\nmental self-defense could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and\\nartificial cause.\\n\\n[Illustration: _The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable!\\nSome fiendish violation of natural law!_]\\n\\nWe had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned,\\nany theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other\\nthan natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself\\ncould scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time\\nwhen this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial\\ndeath?\\n\\nYet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this\\nCyclopean maze of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which\\ncut off all comfortable refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous\\ncity of the mirage in stark, objective, and ineluctable reality. That\\ndamnable portent had had a material basis after all--there had been\\nsome horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this shocking\\nstone survival had projected its image across the mountains according\\nto the simple laws of reflection. Of course, the phantom had been\\ntwisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source\\ndid not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it\\neven more hideous and menacing than its distant image.\\n\\n[Illustration: _It was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the\\nmirage--in stark, objective reality!_]\\n\\nOnly the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers\\nand ramparts had saved the frightful thing from utter annihilation in\\nthe hundreds of thousands--perhaps millions--of years it had brooded\\nthere amidst the blasts of a bleak upland. \"Corona Mundi--Roof of the\\nWorld----\" All sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we\\nlooked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle.\\n\\nI thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently\\nhaunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world--of\\nthe demonic plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men\\nof the Himalayas, of the Pnakotic Manuscripts with their prehuman\\nimplications, of the Cthulhu cult, of the _Necronomicon_, and of the\\nHyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and the worse than formless\\nstar spawn associated with that semientity.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nFor boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with\\nvery little thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and\\nleft along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it\\nfrom the actual mountain rim, we decided that we could see no thinning\\nat all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through\\nwhich we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of\\nsomething of incalculable extent.\\n\\nThe foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone\\nstructures, linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and\\nramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts. These latter,\\nas well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the\\nouter sides of the mountains.\\n\\nThe nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of\\nwalls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height,\\nand of a thickness varying from five to ten feet. It was composed\\nmostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate, schist, and\\nsandstone--blocks in many cases as large as 4 × 6 × 8 feet--though in\\nseveral places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed rock\\nof pre-Cambrian slate.\\n\\nThe buildings were far from equal in size, there being innumerable\\nhoneycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate\\nstructures.\\n\\nThe general shape of these things tended to be conical, pyramidal, or\\nterraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes,\\nclusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar\\nsprinkling of angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly\\nsuggested modern fortifications. The builders had made constant and\\nexpert use of the principle of the arch, and domes had probably existed\\nin the city\\'s heyday.\\n\\nThe whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface\\nfrom where the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and\\nimmemorial débris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see\\nthe lower parts of the gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved\\nstone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances\\nabove the ground. On the exposed walls we could detect the scarred\\nplaces where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed.\\n\\nCloser inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of which\\nwere closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood,\\nthough most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion.\\n\\nMany of the ruins, of course, were roofless, and with uneven though\\nwind-rounded upper edges; whilst others, of a more sharply conical or\\npyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures,\\npreserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and\\npitting. With the field glass we could barely make out what seemed to\\nbe sculptural decorations in horizontal bands--decorations including\\nthose curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones\\nnow assumed a vastly larger significance.\\n\\nIn many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet\\ndeeply riven from various geologic causes. In other places the\\nstonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation. One\\nbroad swath, extending from the plateau\\'s interior to a cleft in the\\nfoothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed, was\\nwholly free from buildings. It probably represented, we concluded,\\nthe course of some great river which in Tertiary times--millions\\nof years ago--had poured through the city and into some prodigious\\nsubterranean abyss of the great barrier range. Certainly, this was\\nabove all a region of caves, gulfs, and underground secrets beyond\\nhuman penetration.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nLooking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing\\nthis monstrous survival from æons we had thought prehuman, I can only\\nwonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium which we did.\\nOf course, we knew that something--chronology, scientific theory, or\\nour own consciousness--was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to\\nguide the plane, observe many things quite minutely, and take a careful\\nseries of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good\\nstead.\\n\\nIn my case, ingrained scientific habit may have helped; for above all\\nmy bewilderment and sense of menace there burned a dominant curiosity\\nto fathom more of this age-old secret--to know what sort of beings\\nhad built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and what\\nrelation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a\\nconcentration of life could have had.\\n\\nFor this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the\\nprimary nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of\\nearth\\'s history whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the\\nmost obscure and distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos\\nof terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled\\nout of apedom.\\n\\nHere sprawled a Palæogæan megalopolis compared with which the fabled\\nAtlantis and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and Olathoë in the\\nland of Lomar are recent things of to-day--not even of yesterday;\\na megalopolis ranking with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as\\nValusia, R\\'lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar, and the Nameless City of\\nArabia Deserta.\\n\\nAs we flew above that tangle of stark Titan towers my imagination\\nsometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic\\nassociations--even weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my\\nown wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp.\\n\\nThe plane\\'s fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had\\nbeen only partly filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our\\nexplorations. Even so, however, we covered an enormous extent of\\nground--or rather, air--after swooping down to a level where the wind\\nbecame virtually negligible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no limit to the mountain range, or to the length\\nof the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills. Fifty\\nmiles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the\\nlabyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the\\neternal ice.\\n\\nThere were, though, some highly absorbing diversifications; such as\\nthe carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the\\nfoothills and approached its sinking place in the great range.\\n\\nThe headlands at the stream\\'s entrance had been boldly carved into\\nCyclopean pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs\\nstirred up oddly vague, hateful, and confusing semiremembrances in both\\nDanforth and me.\\n\\nWe also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public\\nsquares, and noted various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp\\nhill rose, it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling\\nstone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions. Of these latter,\\none was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting\\neminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument\\ncarved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the\\nwell-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra.\\n\\nFlying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was\\nnot of infinite width, even though its length along the foothills\\nseemed endless. After about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings\\nbegan to thin out, and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste\\nvirtually without signs of sentient artifice. The course of the river\\nbeyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed line, while the\\nland assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly\\nupward as it receded in the mist-hazed west.\\n\\nSo far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an\\nattempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been\\ninconceivable. Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on the\\nfoothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and\\npreparing to do some exploration on foot.\\n\\nThough these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of\\nruins, low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landing\\nplaces. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our next flight would\\nbe across the great range and back to camp, we succeeded about twelve\\nthirty p.m. in coming down on a smooth, hard snow field wholly devoid\\nof obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favorable take-off later\\non.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for\\nso brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this\\nlevel; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged,\\nand that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold.\\n\\nFor our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and\\ntook with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera,\\nlight provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist\\'s hammer\\nand chisel, specimen bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric\\ntorches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried in the\\nplane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take\\nground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain\\nrock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave.\\n\\nFortunately, we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a\\nspare specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds\\nfor marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to\\npenetrate. This had been brought in case we found some cave system with\\nair quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the\\nusual rock-chipping method of trail blazing.\\n\\nWalking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow, toward the\\nstupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west,\\nwe felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on\\napproaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously.\\n\\nTrue, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret\\nconcealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering\\nprimordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years\\nago--before any known race of men could have existed--was none the\\nless awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic\\nabnormality.\\n\\nThough the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made\\nexertion somewhat more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found\\nourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which\\nmight fall to our lot.\\n\\nIt took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level\\nwith the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge,\\nroofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline,\\nand rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this\\nlatter we headed; and when at last we were actually able to touch\\nits weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an\\nunprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten æons normally\\nclosed to our species.\\n\\nThis rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from\\npoint to point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular\\nsize, averaging 6 x 8 feet in surface. There was a row of arched\\nloopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high, spaced\\nquite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner\\nangles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface.\\n\\nLooking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five\\nfeet thick, that there were no partitions remaining within, and that\\nthere were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior\\nwalls--facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this\\nrampart and others like it. Though lower parts must have originally\\nexisted, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep\\nlayer of ice and snow at this point.\\n\\nWe crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher\\nthe nearly effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb\\nthe glaciated floor. Our orientation flights had indicated that many\\nbuildings in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might\\nperhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground\\nlevel if we entered those structures still roofed at the top.\\n\\nBefore we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied\\nits mortarless Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished\\nthat Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have\\nhelped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that\\nunbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind\\nshrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the\\nbackground, was something of which the smallest details will always\\nremain engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any\\nhuman beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects.\\n\\nBetween us and the churning vapors of the west lay that monstrous\\ntangle of dark stone towers, its outré and incredible forms impressing\\nus afresh at every new angle of vision. It was a mirage in solid stone,\\nand were it not for the photographs I would still doubt that such a\\nthing could be. The general type of masonry was identical with that\\nof the rampart we had examined; but the extravagant shapes which this\\nmasonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description.\\n\\nEven the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless\\nvariety, preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism. There\\nwere geometrical forms for which an Euclid could scarcely find a\\nname--cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation, terraces\\nof every sort of provocative disproportion, shafts with odd bulbous\\nenlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and five-pointed or\\nfive-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.\\n\\nAs we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the\\nice sheet, and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected\\nthe crazily sprinkled structures at various heights. Of orderly streets\\nthere seemed to be none, the only broad open swath being a mile to the\\nleft, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town\\ninto the mountains.\\n\\nOur field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly\\neffaced sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could\\nhalf imagine what the city must once have looked like--even though most\\nof the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished.\\n\\nAs a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys,\\nall of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because\\nof the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges.\\n\\nNow, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream phantasy against a\\nwestward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun\\nof early afternoon was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment,\\nthat sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into\\ntemporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never\\nhope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in\\nthe great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful\\nmalignity.\\n\\nThe last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and\\nabrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led\\nus to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under\\nthe glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its\\nequivalent.\\n\\nWhen at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen\\nmasonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height\\nof omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became\\nsuch that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained.\\n\\nDanforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively\\nirrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp--which I resented\\nall the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions\\nforced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare\\nantiquity.\\n\\nThe speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one\\nplace--where a débris-littered alley turned a sharp corner--he insisted\\nthat he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like;\\nwhilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound\\nfrom some undefined point--a muffled musical piping, he said, not\\nunlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly\\ndifferent.\\n\\nThe ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and\\nof the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister\\nsuggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of terrible\\nsubconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared\\nand dwelt in this unhallowed place.\\n\\nNevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly\\ndead, and we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens\\nfrom all the different rock types represented in the masonry. We wished\\na rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age\\nof the place.\\n\\nNothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the\\nJurassic and Comanchean periods, nor was any piece of stone in the\\nentire place of a greater recency than the Pliocene age. In stark\\ncertainty, we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least\\nfive hundred thousand years, and in all probability even longer.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped\\nat all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance\\npossibilities. Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into\\nice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill.\\n\\nOne, though spacious and inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless\\nabyss without visible means of descent. Now and then we had a chance to\\nstudy the petrified wood of a surviving shutter, and were impressed by\\nthe fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain. These\\nthings had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and conifers--especially\\nCretaceous cycads--and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly\\nTertiary date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene could be\\ndiscovered.\\n\\nIn the placing of these shutters--whose edges showed the former\\npresence of queer and long-vanished hinges--usage seemed to be\\nvaried--some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the\\ndeep embrasures. They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus\\nsurviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures\\nand fastenings.\\n\\nAfter a time we came across a row of windows--in the bulges of a\\ncolossal five-edged cone of undamaged apex--which led into a vast,\\nwell-preserved room with stone flooring; but these were too high in\\nthe room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope with us,\\nbut did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged\\nto--especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made\\nupon the heart action.\\n\\nThis enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and\\nour electric torches showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling\\nsculptures arranged round the walls in broad, horizontal bands\\nseparated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques. We took\\ncareful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily\\ngained interior was encountered.\\n\\nFinally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an\\narchway about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end\\nof an aërial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above\\nthe present level of glaciation. These archways, of course, were flush\\nwith upper-story floors, and in this case one of the floors still\\nexisted.\\n\\nThe building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces\\non our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other\\narchway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with\\na curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally\\ndark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable\\nemptiness.\\n\\nHeaped débris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly\\neasy, yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the\\nlong-wished chance. For though we had penetrated into this tangle of\\narchaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually\\ninside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world\\nwhose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us.\\n\\nIn the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the\\nrubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate\\nslabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with\\nsculptured walls.\\n\\nObserving the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing\\nthe probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided\\nthat we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto\\nour compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain\\nrange between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent our\\nlosing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be\\nnecessary.\\n\\nAccordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size,\\nplaced these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use\\nthem as economically as safety would allow. This method would probably\\ngain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any\\nstrong air currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should\\ndevelop, or if our paper supply should give out, we could of course\\nfall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method\\nof rock chipping.\\n\\nJust how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible\\nto guess without a trial. The close and frequent connection of the\\ndifferent buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to\\nanother on bridges underneath the ice, except where impeded by local\\ncollapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have\\nentered the massive constructions.\\n\\nAlmost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged\\nwindows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that\\nuniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower\\npart for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious impression\\nthat this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim,\\nbygone æon, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even\\ngradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a\\nnameless population left _en masse_ to seek a less doomed abode?\\n\\nThe precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the\\nice sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution. It had\\nnot, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of\\naccumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some flood from\\nthe river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the\\ngreat range, had helped to create the special state now observable.\\nImagination could conceive almost anything in connection with this\\nplace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  VI.\\n\\n\\nIt would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of\\nour wanderings inside that cavernous, æon-dead honeycomb of primal\\nmasonry--that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the\\nfirst time, after uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet.\\n\\nThis is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and\\nrevelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings.\\nOur flash-light photographs of those carvings will do much toward\\nproving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is lamentable\\nthat we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made crude\\nnotebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were\\nused up.\\n\\nThe building which we had entered was one of great size and\\nelaborateness, and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of\\nthat nameless geologic past. The inner partitions were less massive\\nthan the outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently\\npreserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously irregular\\ndifferences in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and\\nwe should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail\\nof torn paper left behind us.\\n\\nWe decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence\\nclimbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to\\nwhere the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to\\nthe polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed\\nstone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of\\nstairs.\\n\\nThe rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions,\\nranging from five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It\\nmight be safe to say that their general average was about 30 x 30 feet\\nin floor area, and twenty feet in height, though many larger apartments\\nexisted.\\n\\nAfter thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level\\nwe descended, story by story, into the submerged part, where indeed\\nwe soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and\\npassages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular\\nbuilding.\\n\\nThe Cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became\\ncuriously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but deeply\\nunhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and\\nconstructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon\\nrealized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was\\nmany million years old.\\n\\nWe cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous\\nbalancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function\\nof the arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were\\nwholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained\\nour belief in the city\\'s deliberate desertion. The prime decorative\\nfeature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture, which\\ntended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and\\narranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width\\ngiven over to geometrical arabesques.\\n\\nThere were exceptions to this rule of arrangement, but its\\npreponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, a series of smooth\\ncartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk\\nalong one of the arabesque bands.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and æsthetically\\nevolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly\\nalien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race.\\nIn delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach\\nit. The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life,\\nwere rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the\\ncarvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful\\nintricacy.\\n\\nThe arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and\\nwere made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the\\nquantity of five.\\n\\nThe pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition, and\\ninvolved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic force\\nthat moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast\\ngeologic periods.\\n\\nTheir method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross\\nsection with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical\\npsychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to\\ntry to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who\\nsee our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain\\ngrotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists.\\n\\nThe arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose\\ndepth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When\\ncartouches with dot groups appeared--evidently as inscriptions in some\\nunknown and primordial language and alphabet--the depression of the\\nsmooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps\\na half inch more. The pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief,\\ntheir background being depressed about two inches from the original\\nwall surface.\\n\\nIn some specimens marks of a former coloration could be detected,\\nthough for the most part the untold æons had disintegrated and banished\\nany pigments which may have been applied. The more one studied the\\nmarvelous technique the more one admired the things. Beneath their\\nstrict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate\\nobservation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very\\nconventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real\\nessence or vital differentiation of every object delineated.\\n\\nWe felt, too, that besides these recognizable excellences there\\nwere others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions. Certain\\ntouches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli\\nwhich another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or\\ndifferent sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant\\nsignificance to us.\\n\\nThe subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of\\nthe vanished epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion\\nof evident history. It is this abnormal historic-mindedness of the\\nprimal race--a chance circumstance operating, through coincidence,\\nmiraculously in our favor--which made the carvings so awesomely\\ninformative to us, and which caused us to place their photography and\\ntranscription above all other considerations.\\n\\nIn certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of\\nmaps, astronomical charts, and other scientific designs on an enlarged\\nscale--these things giving a naïve and terrible corroboration to what\\nwe gathered from the pictorial friezes and dados.\\n\\nIn hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my account\\nwill not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of\\nthose who believe me at all. It would be tragic if any were to be\\nallured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to\\ndiscourage them.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nInterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive\\ntwelve-foot doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden\\nplanks--elaborately carved and polished--of the actual shutters and\\ndoors. All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors\\nremained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room\\nto room.\\n\\nWindow frames with odd transparent panes--mostly elliptical--survived\\nhere and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also\\nfrequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a\\nwhile containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which\\nwas either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal.\\n\\nOther apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical\\nfacilities--heating, lighting, and the like--of a sort suggested in\\nmany of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes\\nbeen inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now.\\nFloors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework\\npredominated.\\n\\nAs I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the\\nsculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once\\nfilled these tomblike, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the\\nfloors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and débris, but\\nfarther down this condition decreased.\\n\\nIn some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than\\ngritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an\\nuncanny air of newly swept immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or\\ncollapses had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the\\nupper ones.\\n\\nA central court--as we had seen in other structures, from the\\nair--saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had\\nto use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying\\nsculptured details. Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened;\\nand in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to\\nabsolute blackness.\\n\\nTo form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we\\npenetrated this æon-silent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate\\na hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and\\nimpressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the\\nplace were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added\\nto these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and\\nthe revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures\\naround us.\\n\\nThe moment we came upon a perfect section of carving, where no\\nambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief study\\nto give us the hideous truth--a truth which it would be naïve to claim\\nDanforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had\\ncarefully refrained from even hinting it to each other. There could\\nnow be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which\\nhad built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years\\nago, when man\\'s ancestors were primitive archaic mammals, and vast\\nDinosauria roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and Asia.\\n\\nWe had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted--each\\nto himself--that the omnipresence of the five-pointed motif meant only\\nsome cultural or religious exaltation of the archæan natural object\\nwhich had so patently embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the\\ndecorative motifs of Minoan Crete exalted the sacred bull, those of\\nEgypt the scarabæus, those of Rome the wolf and the eagle, and those of\\nvarious savage tribes some chosen totem animal.\\n\\nBut this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and we were forced to\\nface definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of\\nthese pages has doubtless long ago anticipated. I can scarcely bear to\\nwrite it down in black and white even now, but perhaps that will not be\\nnecessary.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the\\nage of Dinosauria were not indeed Dinosauria, but far worse. Mere\\nDinosauria were new and almost brainless objects--but the builders of\\nthe city were wise and old, and had left certain traces in rocks even\\nthen laid down well nigh a thousand million years--rocks laid down\\nbefore the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of\\ncells--rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all.\\n\\nThey were the makers and enslavers of that life, and above all doubt\\nthe originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the\\nPnakotic Manuscripts and the _Necronomicon_ affrightedly hint about.\\nThey were the great \"Old Ones\" that had filtered down from the stars\\nwhen earth was young--the beings whose substance an alien evolution had\\nshaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred. And\\nto think that only the day before Danforth and I had actually looked\\nupon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance--and that\\npoor Lake and his party had seen their complete outlines----\\n\\nIt is, of course, impossible for me to relate in proper order the\\nstages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of\\nprehuman life. After the first shock of the certain revelation, we had\\nto pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully three o\\'clock before\\nwe got started on our actual tour of systematic research.\\n\\nThe sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late\\ndate--perhaps two million years ago--as checked up by geological,\\nbiological, and astronomical features--and embodied an art which would\\nbe called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in\\nolder buildings, after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet.\\n\\nOne edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or\\npossibly even fifty million years--to the lower Eocene or upper\\nCretaceous--and contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing\\nanything else, with one tremendous exception, that we encountered. That\\nwas, we have since agreed, the oldest domestic structure we traversed.\\n\\nWere it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made\\npublic, I would refrain from telling what I found and inferred, lest I\\nbe confined as a madman. Of course, the infinitely early parts of the\\npatchwork tale--representing the preterrestrial life of the star-headed\\nbeings on other planets, in other galaxies, and in other universes--can\\nreadily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings\\nthemselves; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so\\nuncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics\\nthat I scarcely know what to think. Let others judge when they see the\\nphotographs I shall publish.\\n\\nNaturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a\\nfraction of any connected story, nor did we even begin to come upon the\\nvarious stages of that story in their proper order. Some of the vast\\nrooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned,\\nwhilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a\\nseries of rooms and corridors.\\n\\nThe best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful\\nabyss below even the ancient ground level--a cavern perhaps two hundred\\nfeet square and sixty feet high, which had almost undoubtedly been an\\neducational center of some sort.\\n\\nThere were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different\\nrooms and buildings, since certain chapters of experience, and certain\\nsummaries or phases of racial history, had evidently been favorites\\nwith different decorators or dwellers. Sometimes, though, variant\\nversions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points\\nand filling up gaps.\\n\\nI still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our\\ndisposal. Of course, we even now have only the barest outline--and\\nmuch of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and\\nsketches we made.\\n\\nIt may be the effect of this later study--the revived memories and\\nvague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness\\nand with that final supposed horror-glimpse whose essence he will not\\nreveal even to me--which has been the immediate source of Danforth\\'s\\npresent breakdown.\\n\\nBut it had to be; for we could not issue our warning intelligently\\nwithout the fullest possible information, and the issuance of that\\nwarning is a prime necessity. Certain lingering influences in that\\nunknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make\\nit imperative that further exploration be discouraged.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 VII.\\n\\n\\nThe full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an\\nofficial bulletin of Miskatonic University. Here I shall sketch only\\nthe salient highlights in a formless, rambling way. Myth or otherwise,\\nthe sculptures told of the coming of those star-headed things to the\\nnascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic space--their coming, and the\\ncoming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark\\nupon spatial pioneering.\\n\\nThey seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast\\nmembranous wings--thus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long\\nago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived under the sea a\\ngood deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with\\nnameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown\\nprinciples of energy.\\n\\nEvidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed\\nman\\'s to-day, though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate\\nforms only when obliged to.\\n\\nSome of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage\\nof mechanized life on other planets, but had receded upon finding\\nits effects emotionally unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness\\nof organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly\\nable to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits\\nof artificial manufacture, and even without garments, except for\\noccasional protection against the elements.\\n\\nIt was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes,\\nthat they first created earth life--using available substances\\naccording to long-known methods.\\n\\nThe more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various\\ncosmic enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having\\nmanufactured not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular\\nprotoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of\\ntemporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal\\nslaves to perform the heavy work of the community.\\n\\nThese viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered\\nabout as the \"Shoggoths\" in his frightful _Necronomicon_, though even\\nthat mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the\\ndreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb.\\n\\nWhen the star-headed Old Ones on this planet had synthesized their\\nsimple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed\\nother cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable\\nlife for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became\\ntroublesome.\\n\\nWith the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift\\nprodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast\\nand imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on\\nland. Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in\\nother parts of the universe, and probably retained many traditions of\\nland construction.\\n\\nAs we studied the architecture of all these sculptured Palæogæan\\ncities, including that whose æon-dead corridors we were even then\\ntraversing, we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have\\nnot yet tried to explain, even to ourselves. The tops of the buildings,\\nwhich in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into\\nshapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs,\\nand showed vast clusters of needlelike spires, delicate finials\\non certain cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal\\nscalloped disks capping cylindrical shafts.\\n\\nThis was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous\\nmirage, cast by a dead city whence such sky-line features had been\\nabsent for thousands and ten of thousands of years, which loomed on our\\nignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first\\napproached poor Lake\\'s ill-fated camp.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOf the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them\\nmigrated to land, volumes could be written. Those in shallow water had\\ncontinued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main\\nhead tentacles, and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing\\nin quite the usual way--the writing accomplished with a stylus on\\nwaterproof waxen surfaces.\\n\\nThose lower down in the ocean depths, though they used a curious\\nphosphorescent organism to furnish light, pieced out their vision with\\nobscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their\\nheads--senses which rendered all the Old Ones partly independent of\\nlight in emergencies. Their forms of sculpture and writing had changed\\ncuriously during the descent, embodying certain apparently chemical\\ncoating processes--probably to secure phosphorescence--which the\\nbas-reliefs could not make clear to us.\\n\\nThe beings moved in the sea partly by swimming--using the lateral\\ncrinoid arms--and partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles\\ncontaining the pseudofeet. Occasionally they accomplished long swoops\\nwith the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fan-like folding\\nwings.\\n\\nOn land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and then flew to\\ngreat heights or over long distances with their wings. The many\\nslender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely\\ndelicate, flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous\\ncoördination--ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic\\nand other manual operations.\\n\\nThe toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even the terrific\\npressure of the deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them.\\nVery few seemed to die at all except by violence, and their burial\\nplaces were very limited. The facts that they covered their vertically\\ninhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts in\\nDanforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary\\nafter the sculptures revealed it.\\n\\n[Illustration: _The toughness of the things was almost incredible. Even\\nterrific pressures were powerless to harm them!_]\\n\\nThe beings multiplied by means of spores--like vegetable pteridophyta,\\nas Lake had suspected--but, owing to their prodigious toughness and\\nlongevity, and consequent lack of replacement needs, they did not\\nencourage the large-scale development of new prothallia except when\\nthey had new regions to colonize.\\n\\nThe young matured swiftly, and received an education evidently beyond\\nany standard we can imagine. The prevailing intellectual and æsthetic\\nlife was highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring set of\\ncustoms and institutions which I shall describe more fully in my coming\\nmonograph. These varied slightly according to sea or land residence,\\nbut had the same foundations and essentials.\\n\\nThough able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic\\nsubstances; they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food.\\nThey ate uncooked marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands on\\nland. They hunted game and raised meat herds--slaughtering with sharp\\nweapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had\\nnoted.\\n\\nThey resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously, and in their\\nnatural state could live in water down to freezing. When the great\\nchill of the Pleistocene drew on, however--nearly a million years\\nago--the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including\\nartificial heating--until, at last, the deadly cold appears to have\\ndriven them back into the sea.\\n\\nFor their prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they\\nhad absorbed certain chemicals and become almost independent of eating,\\nbreathing, or heat conditions--but by the time of the great cold\\nthey had lost track of the method. In any case, they could not have\\nprolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harm.\\n\\nBeing nonpairing and semivegetable in structure, the Old Ones had\\nno biological basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed\\nto organize large households on the principles of comfortable\\nspace-utility and--as we deduced from the pictured occupations and\\ndiversions of codwellers--congenial mental association.\\n\\nIn furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the\\nhuge rooms, leaving all wall spaces free for decorative treatment.\\nLighting, in the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a\\ndevice probably electro-chemical in nature.\\n\\nBoth on land and under water they used curious tables, chairs and\\ncouches like cylindrical frames--for they rested and slept upright with\\nfolded-down tentacles--and racks for the hinged sets of dotted surfaces\\nforming their books.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nGovernment was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no\\ncertainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we\\nsaw. There was extensive commerce, both local and between different\\ncities--certain small, flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed,\\nserving as money. Probably the smaller of the various greenish\\nsoapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency.\\n\\nThough the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock\\nraising existed. Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also\\npracticed. Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed\\nrelatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the\\nrace expanded.\\n\\nFor personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air,\\nand water movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively\\nvast capacities for speed. Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of\\nburden--Shoggoths under the sea, and a curious variety of primitive\\nvertebrates in the later years of land existence.\\n\\nThese vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life forms--animal\\nand vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and aërial--were the products of\\nunguided evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but\\nescaping beyond their radius of attention. They had been suffered\\nto develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the\\ndominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically\\nexterminated.\\n\\nIt interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent\\nsculptures a shambling, primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and\\nsometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely\\nsimian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of\\nland cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally\\nlifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to\\npalæontology.\\n\\nThe persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic\\nchanges and convulsions of the earth\\'s crust was little short of\\nmiraculous. Though few or none of their first cities seem to have\\nremained beyond the Archæan Age, there was no interruption in their\\ncivilization or in the transmission of their records.\\n\\nTheir original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean,\\nand it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the\\nmoon was wrenched from the neighboring South Pacific. According to one\\nof the sculptured maps, the whole globe was then under water, with\\nstone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as æons\\npassed.\\n\\nAnother map shows a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole, where\\nit is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements,\\nthough their main centers were transferred to the nearest sea bottom.\\n\\nLater maps, which display this land mass as cracking and drifting, and\\nsending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way the\\ntheories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and\\nJoly.\\n\\nWith the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific, tremendous events\\nbegan. Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that\\nwas not the worst misfortune. Another race--a land race of beings\\nshaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous prehuman\\nspawn of Cthulhu--soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and\\nprecipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones\\nwholly back to the sea--a colossal blow in view of the increasing land\\nsettlements.\\n\\nLater, peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu\\nspawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands. New land\\ncities were founded--the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this\\nregion of first arrival was sacred.\\n\\nFrom then on, as before, the antarctic remained the center of the Old\\nOnes\\' civilization, and all the cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn\\nwere blotted out.\\n\\nThen, suddenly, the lands of the Pacific sank again, taking with them\\nthe frightful stone city of R\\'lyeh and all the cosmic octopi, so that\\nthe Old Ones were again supreme on the planet, except for one shadowy\\nfear about which they did not like to speak.\\n\\nAt a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas\\nof the globe--hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some\\narchæologist make systematic borings with Pabodie\\'s type of apparatus\\nin certain widely separated regions.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThe steady trend down the ages was from water to land--a movement\\nencouraged by the rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never\\nwholly deserted. Another cause of the landward movement was the new\\ndifficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful\\nsea life depended.\\n\\nWith the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of\\ncreating new life from inorganic matter had been lost, so that the Old\\nOnes had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence. On\\nland the great reptiles proved highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of\\nthe sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of\\naccidental intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.\\n\\nThey had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestion of\\nthe Old Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various\\nuseful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers\\nwere sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative\\nforms implanted by past suggestion. They had, it seems, developed a\\nsemistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition\\nechoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it.\\n\\nSculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with\\nhorror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed\\nof a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and\\neach averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere. They had,\\nhowever, a constantly shifting shape and volume--throwing out temporary\\ndevelopments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech\\nin imitation of their masters, either spontaneously or according to\\nsuggestion.\\n\\nThey seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of\\nthe Permian Age, perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago, when\\na veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old\\nOnes. Pictures of this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion\\nin which the Shoggoths typically left their slain victims, held a\\nmarvelously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold\\nages.\\n\\nThe Old Ones had used curious weapons of molecular disturbance against\\nthe rebel entities, and in the end had achieved a complete victory.\\nThereafter the sculptures showed a period in which Shoggoths were tamed\\nand broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the American west\\nwere tamed by cowboys.\\n\\nThough during the rebellion the Shoggoths had shown an ability to\\nlive out of water, this transition was not encouraged--since their\\nusefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble\\nof their management.\\n\\nDuring the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the\\nform of a new invasion from outer space--this time by half-fungous,\\nhalf-crustacean creatures--creatures undoubtedly the same as those\\nfiguring in certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered\\nin the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men.\\n\\nTo fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time\\nsince their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary\\nether; but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer\\npossible to leave the earth\\'s atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of\\ninterstellar travel had been, it was now definitely lost to the race.\\n\\nIn the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all the northern lands,\\nthough they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little by\\nlittle the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic\\nhabitat was beginning.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu\\nspawn and the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely\\ndifferent from that which we know than was the substance of the Old\\nOnes. They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations\\nimpossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally\\ncome from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space.\\n\\nThe Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital\\nproperties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute\\norigin within the known space-time continuum--whereas the first\\nsources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath.\\nAll this, of course, assuming that the nonterrestrial linkages and\\nthe anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology.\\nConceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic framework\\nto account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest\\nand pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is\\nsignificant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and\\npotent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering ethics figure\\npersistently in certain obscure legends.\\n\\nThe changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared\\nwith startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes. In\\ncertain cases existing science will require revision, while in other\\ncases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed.\\n\\nAs I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and Joly that all\\nthe continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which\\ncracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically\\nviscous lower surface--an hypothesis suggested by such things as the\\ncomplimentary outlines of Africa and South America, and the way the\\ngreat mountain chains are rolled and shoved up--receives striking\\nsupport from this uncanny source.\\n\\nMaps evidently showing the Carboniferous of a hundred million or\\nmore years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later\\nto separate Africa from the once continuous realms of Europe (then\\nthe Valusia of primal legend), Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic\\ncontinent.\\n\\nOther charts--and most significantly one in connection with the\\nfounding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around\\nus--showed all the present continents well differentiated. And in\\nthe latest discoverable specimen--dating perhaps from the Pliocene\\nAge--the approximate world of to-day appeared quite clearly despite the\\nlinkage of Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through\\nGreenland, and of South America with the antarctic continent through\\nGraham Land.\\n\\nIn the Carboniferous map the whole globe--ocean floor and rifted land\\nmass alike--bore symbols of the Old Ones\\' vast stone cities, but in the\\nlater charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very\\nplain.\\n\\nThe final Pliocene specimen showed no land cities except on the\\nantarctic continent and the tip of South America, nor any ocean\\ncities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude. Knowledge\\nand interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast lines\\nprobably made during long exploration flights on those fan-like\\nmembranous wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones.\\n\\nDestruction of cities through the up-thrust of mountains, the\\ncentrifugal rending of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or\\nsea bottom, and other natural causes was a matter of common record; and\\nit was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as\\nthe ages wore on.\\n\\nThe vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last\\ngeneral center of the race--built early in the Cretaceous Age after a\\ntitanic earth buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not\\nfar distant.\\n\\nIt appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of\\nall, where reputedly the first Old Ones had settled on a primal sea\\nbottom. In the new city--many of whose features we could recognize\\nin the sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles along\\nthe mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of\\nour aërial survey--there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred\\nstones forming part of the first sea-bottom city, which were thrust up\\nto light after long epochs in the course of the general crumpling of\\nstrata.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 VIII.\\n\\n\\nNaturally, Danforth and I studied with special interest and a\\npeculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate\\ndistrict in which we were. Of this local material there was naturally a\\nvast abundance.\\n\\nOn the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find\\na house of very late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a\\nneighboring rift, contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying\\nthe story of the region, much beyond the Pliocene map, whence we\\nderived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world. This was the\\nlast place we examined in detail, since what we found there set upon us\\na fresh, immediate objective.\\n\\nCertainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible\\nof all the corners of earth\\'s globe. Of all existing lands it was\\ninfinitely the most ancient. The conviction grew upon us that this\\nhideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of Leng\\nwhich even the mad author of the _Necronomicon_ was reluctant to\\ndiscuss.\\n\\nThe great mountain chain was tremendously long--starting as a low range\\nat Luitpold Land on the coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the\\nentire continent. The really high part stretched in a mighty arc from\\nabout Latitude 82°, E. Longitude 60° to Latitude 70°, East Longitude\\n115°, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the\\nregion of that long, ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by\\nWilkes and Mawson at the antarctic circle.\\n\\nYet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly\\nclose at hand. I have said that these peaks are higher than the\\nHimalayas, but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth\\'s\\nhighest. That grim honor is beyond doubt reserved for something\\nwhich half the sculptures hesitated to record at all, whilst others\\napproached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation.\\n\\nIt seems that there was one part of the ancient land--the first part\\nthat ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon\\nand the Old Ones had seeped down from the stars--which had come to be\\nshunned as vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled\\nbefore their time, and had been found suddenly deserted.\\n\\nThen when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in\\nthe Comanchean Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up\\namidst the most appalling din and chaos--and earth had received her\\nloftiest and most terrible mountains.\\n\\nIf the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must\\nhave been much over forty thousand feet high--radically vaster than\\neven the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed. They extended,\\nit appeared, from about Latitude 77°, E. Longitude 70° to Latitude 70°,\\nE. Longitude 100°--less than three hundred miles away from the dead\\ncity, so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim\\nwestern distance had it not been for that vague, opalescent haze. Their\\nnorthern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle\\ncoast line at Queen Mary Land.\\n\\nSome of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers\\nto those mountains--but none ever went near them or dared to guess\\nwhat lay beyond. No human eye had ever seen them, and as I studied the\\nemotions conveyed in the carvings I prayed that none ever might.\\n\\nThere are protecting hills along the coast beyond them--Queen Mary and\\nKaiser Wilhelm Lands--and I thank Heaven no one has been able to land\\nand climb those hills. I am not as sceptical about old tales and fears\\nas I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptor\\'s\\nnotion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the\\nbrooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those\\nterrible pinnacles all through the long polar night. There may be a\\nvery real and very monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic whispers about\\nKadath in the Cold Waste.\\n\\nBut the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less\\nnamelessly accursed. Soon after the founding of the city the great\\nmountain range became the seat of the principal temples, and many\\ncarvings showed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky\\nwhere now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts.\\n\\nIn the course of ages the caves had appeared, and had been shaped into\\nadjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later epochs all\\nthe limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters,\\nso that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were\\na veritable network of connected caverns and galleries. Many graphic\\nsculptures told of explorations deep underground, and of the final\\ndiscovery of the Stygian sunless sea that lurked at earth\\'s bowels.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river\\nwhich flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains,\\nand which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones\\' range and\\nflowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten\\nLands on Wilkes\\'s coast line. Little by little it had eaten away the\\nlimestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents\\nreached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in\\ndigging a deeper abyss.\\n\\nFinally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old\\nbed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as we now found it\\nhad been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, understanding what\\nhad happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had\\ncarved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the\\ngreat stream began its descent into eternal darkness.\\n\\nThis river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly\\nthe one whose extinct course we had seen in our aëroplane survey.\\nIts position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient\\nourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region\\'s\\nage-long, æon-dead history, so that we were able to sketch a hasty but\\ncareful map of the salient features--squares, important buildings, and\\nthe like--for guidance in further explorations.\\n\\nWe could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was\\na million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures\\ntold us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and\\nsuburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had\\nlooked like.\\n\\nIt must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of\\nit I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which\\nthe city\\'s inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and\\nglacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit.\\n\\nYet, according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had\\nthemselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a\\nsomber and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shown in\\nthe act of recoiling affrightedly from some object--never allowed to\\nappear in the design--found in the great river and indicated as having\\nbeen washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad forests from those\\nhorrible westward mountains.\\n\\nIt was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that\\nwe obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the\\ncity\\'s desertion. Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of\\nthe same age elsewhere, even allowing for the slackened energies and\\naspirations of a stressful and uncertain period; indeed, very certain\\nevidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward. But\\nthis was the first and only set we directly encountered.\\n\\nWe meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate\\nconditions dictated another present objective. There would, though,\\nhave been a limit--for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the\\nplace had perished among the Old Ones, there could not but have been a\\ncomplete cessation of mural decoration. The ultimate blow, of course,\\nwas the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in\\nthrall, and which has never departed from the ill-fated poles--the\\ngreat cold that, at the world\\'s other extremity, put an end to the\\nfabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea.\\n\\nJust when this tendency began in the antarctic it would be hard to say\\nin terms of exact years. Nowadays we set the beginning of the general\\nglacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years from\\nthe present, but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced\\nmuch earlier. All quantitative estimates are partly guesswork, but it\\nis quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably\\nless than a million years ago, and that the actual desertion of\\nthe city was complete long before the conventional opening of the\\nPleistocene--five hundred thousand years ago--as reckoned in terms of\\nthe earth\\'s whole surface.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIn the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation\\neverywhere, and of a decreased country life on the part of the Old\\nOnes. Heating devices were shown in the houses, and winter travelers\\nwere represented as muffled in protective fabrics. Then we saw a\\nseries of cartouches--the continuous band arrangement being frequently\\ninterrupted in these late carvings--depicting a constantly growing\\nmigration to the nearest refuges of greater warmth--some fleeing to\\ncities under the sea off the far-away coast, and some clambering down\\nthrough networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the\\nneighboring black abyss of subterrane waters.\\n\\nIn the end, it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received\\nthe greatest colonization. This was partly due, no doubt, to the\\ntraditional sacredness of this special region, but may have been more\\nconclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing\\nthe use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains, and for\\nretaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of\\ncommunication with various mines.\\n\\nThe linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means\\nof several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes,\\nincluding the chiseling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient\\nmetropolis to the black abyss--sharply down-pointing tunnels whose\\nmouths we carefully drew, according to our most thoughtful estimates,\\non the guide map we were compiling.\\n\\nIt was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a\\nreasonable exploring distance of where we were--both being on the\\nmountainward edge of the city, one less than a quarter of a mile toward\\nthe ancient rivercourse, and the other perhaps twice that distance in\\nthe opposite direction.\\n\\nThe abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places,\\nbut the Old Ones built their new city under water--no doubt because of\\nits greater certainty of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden sea\\nappears to have been very great, so that the earth\\'s internal heat\\ncould insure its habitability for an indefinite period.\\n\\nThe beings seem to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to\\npart-time--and eventually, of course, whole-time--residence under\\nwater, since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy.\\n\\nThere were many sculptures which showed how they had always frequently\\nvisited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually\\nbathed on the deep bottom of their great river. The darkness of inner\\nearth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to\\nlong antarctic nights.\\n\\nDecadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings\\nhad a truly epic quality where they told of the building of\\nthe new city in the cavern sea. The Old Ones had gone about it\\nscientifically--quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the\\nhoneycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the nearest\\nsubmarine city to perform the construction according to the best\\nmethods.\\n\\nThese workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish\\nthe new venture--Shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and\\nsubsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic\\nmatter to mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAt last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea,\\nits architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship\\ndisplaying relatively little decadence because of the precise\\nmathematical element inherent in building operations.\\n\\nThe newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular\\nintelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with\\nmarvelous quickness. They seemed to converse with the Old Ones by\\nmimicking their voices--a sort of musical piping over a wide range,\\nif poor Lake\\'s dissection had indicated aright--and to work more from\\nspoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times.\\n\\nThey were, however, kept in admirable control. The phosphorescent\\norganisms supplied light with vast effectiveness, and doubtless atoned\\nfor the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outer-world night.\\n\\nArt and decoration were pursued, though, of course, with a certain\\ndecadence. The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves,\\nand in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by\\ntransplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their\\nland city, just as the emperor, in a similar age of decline, stripped\\nGreece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital\\ngreater splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer\\nof sculptured blocks had not been more extensive, was doubtless owing\\nto the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned.\\n\\nBy the time total abandonment did occur--and it surely must have\\noccurred before the polar Pleistocene was far advanced--the Old Ones\\nhad perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art--or had ceased\\nto recognize the superior merit of the older carvings. At any rate,\\nthe æon-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale\\nsculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other\\nmovables, had been taken away.\\n\\nThe decadent cartouches and dados telling this story were, as I have\\nsaid, the latest we could find in our limited search. They left us with\\na picture of the Old Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land\\ncity in summer and the sea-cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading\\nwith the sea-bottom cities off the antarctic coast.\\n\\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been\\nrecognized, for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold\\'s malign\\nencroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the\\nwinter no longer melted completely even in midsummer.\\n\\nThe saurian live stock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were\\nstanding it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper\\nworld it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and\\ncuriously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life--a thing the Old Ones\\nhad formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless,\\nand the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and\\nwhales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque\\npenguins.\\n\\nWhat had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new\\nsea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in\\neternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what\\nfate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered?\\nHad any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap?\\nExisting geology shows no trace of their presence. Had the frightful\\nMi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could\\none be sure of what might or might not linger, even to this day, in the\\nlightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\\'s deepest water?\\n\\nThose things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of\\npressure--and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at\\ntimes. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage\\nand mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by\\nBorchgrevingk?\\n\\nThe specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for\\ntheir geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been\\na very early date in the land city\\'s history. They were, according to\\ntheir location, certainly not less than thirty million years old, and\\nwe reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the\\ncavern itself, had had no existence.\\n\\nThey would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary\\nvegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around\\nthem, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty\\nmountains toward a far-away tropic ocean.\\n\\nAnd yet we could not help thinking about these specimens--especially\\nabout the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\\'s hideously\\nravaged camp. There was something abnormal about that whole\\nbusiness--the strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebody\\'s\\nmadness--those frightful graves--the amount _and nature_ of the\\nmissing material--Gedney--the unearthly toughness of those archaic\\nmonstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed\\nthe race to have----Danforth and I had seen a good deal in the last\\nfew hours, and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many\\nappalling and incredible secrets of primal nature.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  IX.\\n\\n\\nI have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a\\nchange in our immediate objective. This, of course, had to do with the\\nchiseled avenues to the black inner world, of whose existence we had\\nnot known before, but which we were now eager to find and traverse.\\n\\nFrom the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply\\ndescending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring\\ntunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs about\\nthe great abyss, down whose side paths, improved by the Old Ones, led\\nto the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean. To behold this\\nfabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of\\nresistance once we knew of the thing--yet we realized we must begin the\\nquest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip.\\n\\nIn was now eight p.m., and we had not enough battery replacements to\\nlet our torches burn on forever. We had done so much of our studying\\nand copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at\\nleast five hours of nearly continuous use, and despite the special dry\\ncell formula would obviously be good for only about four more--though\\nby keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or\\ndifficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that.\\n\\nIt would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean catacombs,\\nhence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further\\nmural deciphering. Of course, we intended to revisit the place for days\\nand perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography--curiosity having\\nlong ago gotten the better of horror--but just now we must hasten.\\n\\nOur supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were\\nreluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment\\nit, but we did let one large notebook go. If worst came to worst, we\\ncould resort to rock chipping--and, of course, it would be possible,\\neven in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by\\none channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial\\nand error. So, at last, we set off eagerly in the indicated direction\\nof the nearest tunnel.\\n\\nAccording to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired\\ntunnel mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where\\nwe stood; the intervening space showing solid-looking buildings quite\\nlikely to be penetrable still at a subglacial level. The opening itself\\nwould be in the basement--on the angle nearest the foothills--of a\\nvast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial\\nnature, which we tried to identify from our aërial survey of the ruins.\\n\\nNo such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we\\nconcluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had\\nbeen totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed. In the latter\\ncase the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would\\nhave to try the next nearest one--the one less than a mile to the north.\\n\\nThe intervening river course prevented our trying any of the more\\nsouthern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring\\nones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant\\nan attempt on the next northerly one--about a mile beyond our second\\nchoice.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map\\nand compass--traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or\\npreservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges\\nand clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of\\ndébris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily\\nimmaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our way (in such\\ncases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while\\nstriking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or\\ntrickled down--we were repeatedly tantalized by the sculptured walls\\nalong our route.\\n\\nWe had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel\\'s\\nmouth--having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the\\ntip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially\\nrich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of\\nlate workmanship--when, about eight thirty p.m., Danforth\\'s keen young\\nnostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual.\\n\\nIf we had had a dog with us, I suppost we would have been warned\\nbefore. At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the\\nformerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reached\\nonly too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching.\\nThere was an odor--and that odor was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably\\nakin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the\\nhorror poor Lake had dissected.\\n\\nOf course, the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it\\nsounds now. There were several conceivable explanations, and we did a\\ngood deal of indecisive whispering. Most important of all, we did not\\nretreat without further investigation; for having come this far, we\\nwere loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster.\\n\\nAnyway, what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe.\\nSuch things did not happen in any normal world. It was probably sheer\\nirrational instinct which made us dim our single torch--tempted no\\nlonger by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly\\nfrom the oppressive walls--and which softened our progress to a\\ncautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor\\nand heaps of débris.\\n\\nDanforth\\'s eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was\\nlikewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the débris after we\\nhad passed many half-choked arches leading to chambers and corridors\\non the ground level. It did not look quite as it ought after countless\\nthousands of years of desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more\\nlight we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked\\nthrough it. The irregular nature of the latter precluded any definite\\nmarks, but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the\\ndragging of heavy objects. Once we thought there was a hint of parallel\\ntracks, as if of runners. This was what made us pause again.\\n\\nIt was during that pause that we caught--simultaneously this time--the\\nother odor ahead. Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and a\\nmore frightful odor--less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely\\nappalling in this place under the known circumstances--unless, of\\ncourse, Gedney----For the odor was the plain and familiar one of common\\npetrol--every-day gasoline.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOur motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists.\\nWe knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must\\nhave crawled into this nighted burial place of the æons, hence could\\nnot doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditions--present\\nor at least recent--just ahead. Yet in the end we did let sheer\\nburning curiosity--or anxiety--or autohypnotism--or vague thoughts of\\nresponsibility toward Gedney--of what not--drive us on.\\n\\nDanforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at\\nthe alley turning in the ruins above; and of the faint musical\\npiping--potentially of tremendous significance in the light of Lake\\'s\\ndissection report, despite its close resemblance to the cave-mouth\\nechoes of the windy peaks--which he thought he had shortly afterward\\nhalf heard from unknown depths below.\\n\\nI, in my turn, whispered of how the camp was left--of what had\\ndisappeared, and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have\\nconceived the inconceivable--a wild trip across the monstrous mountains\\nand a descent into the unknown, primal masonry----\\n\\nBut we could not convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything\\ndefinite. We had turned off all light as we stood still, and vaguely\\nnoticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper daylight kept the\\nblackness from being absolute.\\n\\nHaving automatically begun to move ahead, we guided ourselves by\\noccasional flashes from our torch. The disturbed débris formed an\\nimpression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew\\nstronger. More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until\\nvery soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease. We had been\\nall too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from\\nthe air. Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going\\nto be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture\\nopened.\\n\\nThe torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked\\ncorridor in which we stood, showed several doorways in various\\nstates of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odor--quite\\nsubmerging that other hint of odor--came with especial distinctness. As\\nwe looked more steadily, we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a\\nslight and recent clearing away of débris from that particular opening.\\nWhatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the direct avenue\\ntoward it was now plainly manifest. I do not think any one will wonder\\nthat we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.\\n\\nAnd yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first\\nimpression was one of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse\\nof that sculptured crypt--a perfect cube with sides of about twenty\\nfeet--there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size; so\\nthat we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway.\\n\\nIn another moment, however, Danforth\\'s sharp vision had discovered a\\nplace where the floor débris had been disturbed. We turned on both\\ntorches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually\\nsimple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because\\nof what it implied.\\n\\nIt was a rough leveling of the débris, upon which several small objects\\nlay carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable\\namount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a\\nstrong odor even at this extreme superplateau altitude. In other words,\\nit could not be other than a sort of camp--a camp made by questing\\nbeings who, like us, had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked\\nway to the abyss.\\n\\nLet me be plain. The scattered objects were, so far as substance was\\nconcerned, all from Lake\\'s camp, and consisted of: tin cans as queerly\\nopened as those we had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches,\\nthree illustrated books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink\\nbottle with its pictorial and instructional carton, a broken fountain\\npen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent cloth, a used\\nelectric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with\\nour type of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers.\\n\\nIt was all bad enough, but when we smoothed out the papers and looked\\nat what was on them we felt we had come to the worst. We had found\\ncertain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have\\nprepared us, yet the effect of the sight, down there in the prehuman\\nvaults of a nightmare city, was almost too much to bear.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nA mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of\\nthose found on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those\\ninsane five-pointed grave mounds might have been made; and he might\\nconceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches--varying in their\\naccuracy--or lack of it--which outlined the neighboring parts of the\\ncity and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside\\nour previous route--a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower\\nin the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our aërial\\nsurvey--to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel mouth\\ntherein.\\n\\nHe might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before\\nus were quite obviously compiled, as our own had been, from late\\nsculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth, though not from the\\nones which we had seen and used. But what this art-blind bungler could\\nnever have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured\\ntechnique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of\\nthe decadent carvings from which they were taken--the characteristic\\nand unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead\\ncity\\'s heyday.\\n\\nThere are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not\\nto flee for our lives after that; since our conclusions were\\nnow--notwithstanding their wildness--completely fixed, and of a nature\\nI need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as\\nthis. Perhaps we were mad--for have I not said those horrible peaks\\nwere mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of the\\nsame spirit--albeit in a less extreme form--in the men who stalk\\ndeadly beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study\\ntheir habits. Half paralyzed with terror though we were, there was\\nnevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity\\nwhich triumphed in the end.\\n\\nOf course, we did not mean to face that--or those--which we knew had\\nbeen there, but we felt that they must be gone by now. They would by\\nthis time have found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss, and\\nhave passed within, to whatever night-black fragments of the past might\\nawait them in the ultimate gulf--the ultimate gulf they had never seen.\\nOr if that entrance, too, was blocked, they would have gone on to the\\nnorth seeking another. They were, we remembered, partly independent of\\nlight.\\n\\nLooking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise\\nform our new emotions took--just what change of immediate objective it\\nwas that so sharpened our sense of expectancy. We certainly did not\\nmean to face what we feared--yet I will not deny that we may have had\\na lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden\\nvantage point.\\n\\nProbably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself,\\nthough there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great\\ncircular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at\\nonce recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower in the carvings,\\nbut appearing only as a prodigious, round aperture from above.\\n\\nSomething about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these\\nhasty diagrams, made us think that its subglacial levels must\\nstill form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied\\narchitectural marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of\\nincredible age, according to the sculptures in which it figured--being\\nindeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if\\npreserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form\\na good present link with the upper world--a shorter route than the one\\nwe were so carefully blazing and probably that by which those others\\nhad descended.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAt any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches--which\\nquite perfectly confirmed our own--and start back over the indicated\\ncourse to the circular place; the course which our nameless\\npredecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighboring\\ngate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our\\njourney--during which we continued to leave an economical trail of\\npaper--for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had\\nreached the cul-de-sac, except that it tended to adhere more closely to\\nthe ground level and even descend to basement corridors.\\n\\nEvery now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks\\nin the débris or litter underfoot; and, after we had passed\\noutside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly\\nconscious--spasmodically--of that more hideous and more persistent\\nscent. After the way had branched from our former course, we sometimes\\ngave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls;\\nnoting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which\\nindeed seem to have formed a main æsthetic outlet for the Old Ones.\\n\\nAbout nine-thirty p.m., while traversing a vaulted corridor whose\\nincreasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and\\nwhose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight\\nahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared that we were\\ncoming to the vast, circular place, and that our distance from the\\nupper air could not be very great.\\n\\nThe corridor ended in an arch, surprisingly low for these megalithic\\nruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond,\\nthere stretched a prodigious round space--fully two hundred feet in\\ndiameter--strewn with débris and containing many choked archways\\ncorresponding to the one we were about to cross. The walls were--in\\navailable spaces--boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic\\nproportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused\\nby the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far beyond anything\\nwe had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily\\nglaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably\\nlower depth.\\n\\nBut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which,\\neluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound\\nspirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart\\nof those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or zikkurats of\\nantique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective\\nwhich confounded the descent with the tower\\'s inner wall, had\\nprevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to\\nseek another avenue to the subglacial level.\\n\\nPabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it\\nin place, but Danforth and I could merely admire and marvel. We could\\nsee mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we saw\\nseemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing was excellently\\npreserved up to the present top of the tower--a highly remarkable\\ncircumstance in view of its exposure--and its shelter had done much to\\nprotect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAs we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous\\ncylinder bottom--fifty million years old, and without doubt the most\\nprimally ancient structure ever to meet our eyes--we saw that the\\nramp-traversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty\\nfeet.\\n\\nThis, we recalled from our aërial survey, meant an outside glaciation\\nof some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane\\nhad been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled\\nmasonry, somewhat sheltered for three fourths of its circumference by\\nthe massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to the\\nsculptures the original tower had stood in the center of an immense\\ncircular plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred\\nfeet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of\\nneedlelike spires along the upper rim.\\n\\nMost of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward--a\\nfortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered\\nand the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp showed sad\\nbattering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways seemed to\\nhave been half cleared.\\n\\nIt took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by\\nwhich those others had descended, and that this would be the logical\\nroute for our own ascent, despite the long trail of paper we had left\\nelsewhere. The tower\\'s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our\\nwaiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and\\nany further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie\\nin this general region.\\n\\nOddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips--even after\\nall we had seen and guessed. Then, as we picked our way cautiously over\\nthe débris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time\\nexcluded all other matters.\\n\\nIt was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle\\nof the ramp\\'s lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto\\nbeen screened from our view. There they were--the three sledges missing\\nfrom Lake\\'s camp--shaken by a hard usage which must have included\\nforcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and débris,\\nas well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places.\\n\\nThey were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and\\ncontained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel\\ncans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging\\nwith books, and some bulging with less obvious contents--everything\\nderived from Lake\\'s equipment.\\n\\nAfter what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure\\nprepared for this encounter. The really great shock came when we\\nstepped over and undid one tarpaulin, whose outlines had peculiarly\\ndisquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested\\nin collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly\\nfrozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some\\nwounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent\\nfurther damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing\\ndog.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  X.\\n\\n\\nMany people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking\\nabout the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber\\ndiscovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately\\nrevived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in\\nupon us and set up a whole new train of speculations.\\n\\nWe had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing\\nin a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our\\nconsciousness--the first sounds we had heard since descending out of\\nthe open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly\\nheights. Well-known and mundane though they were, their presence in\\nthis remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any\\ngrotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have been--since they gave a\\nfresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony.\\n\\nHad it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide\\nrange, which Lake\\'s dissection report had led us to expect in those\\nothers--and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading\\ninto every wind howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror--it\\nwould have had a kind of hellish congruity with the æon-dead region\\naround us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other\\nepochs.\\n\\nAs it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated\\nadjustments--all out tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste\\nutterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life.\\n\\nWhat we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of\\nelder earth from whose supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had\\nevoked a monstrous response. Instead, it was a thing so mockingly\\nnormal and so unerringly familiarized by our sea days off Victoria Land\\nand our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it\\nhere, where such things ought not to be. To be brief--it was simply the\\nraucous squawking of a penguin.\\n\\nThe muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to\\nthe corridor whence we had come--regions manifestly in the direction\\nof that other tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water\\nbird in such a direction--in a world whose surface was one of age-long\\nand uniform lifelessness--could lead to only one conclusion; hence our\\nfirst thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound. It was,\\nindeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat.\\n\\nSeeking its source, we entered an archway from which much débris had\\nbeen cleared; resuming our trail blazing--with an added paper supply\\ntaken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the\\nsledges--when we left daylight behind.\\n\\nAs the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly\\ndiscerned some curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found\\na distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too\\nsuperfluous. The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely\\nwhat our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more\\nnortherly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a bridgeless\\nthoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open.\\n\\nThe tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of\\na large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our\\naërial survey as remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single\\ntorch showed a customary profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to\\nexamine any of these.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSuddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on\\nthe second torch. It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our\\nminds from earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones,\\nhaving left their supplies in the great circular place, must have\\nplanned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss;\\nyet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as\\nif they had never existed.\\n\\nThis white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to\\nrealize at once that it was not one of those others. They were larger\\nand dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over land\\nsurfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their\\nsea-born tentacle equipment. But to say that the white thing did not\\nprofoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an\\ninstant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our\\nreasoned fears regarding those others.\\n\\nThen came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a\\nlateral archway to our left, to join two others of its kind which\\nhad summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin--albeit\\nof a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known\\nking penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual\\neyelessness.\\n\\nWhen we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our\\ntorches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that\\nthey were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species.\\n\\nTheir size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the\\nOld Ones\\' sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that\\nthey were descended from the same stock--undoubtedly surviving through\\na retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had\\ndestroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless\\nslits.\\n\\nThat their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a\\nmoment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf\\'s continued warmth\\nand habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing\\nfancies.\\n\\nWe wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out\\nof their usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city\\nmade it clear that it had at no time been a habitual seasonal rookery,\\nwhilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it\\nseem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled\\nthem.\\n\\nWas it possible that those others had taken some aggressive notion or\\ntried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent\\nodor which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these\\npenguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms\\nwith the Old Ones--an amicable relationship which must have survived in\\nthe abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained.\\n\\nRegretting--in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science--that we\\ncould not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them\\nto their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was\\nnow so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional\\npenguin tracks made clear.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNot long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and\\npeculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were\\napproaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins.\\n\\nThen the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us\\ngasp involuntarily--a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep\\nunderground, fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with\\nlow archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and\\nthat one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke\\nthe symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was\\nthe entrance to the great abyss.\\n\\nIn this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though\\ndecadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few\\nalbino penguins waddled--aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing.\\nThe black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade,\\nits aperture adorned with grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel.\\n\\nFrom that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air\\nand perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; and we wondered what\\nliving entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the\\ncontiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might\\nconceal.\\n\\nWe wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first\\nsuspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves\\nperceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by\\nthe tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed\\nregions of earth\\'s core.\\n\\nEntering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was--at least at the\\nstart--about fifteen feet each way--sides, floor, and arched roof\\ncomposed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely\\ndecorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a later, decadent\\nstyle; and all the construction and carving were marvellously\\nwell-preserved.\\n\\nThe floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus bearing\\noutgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others. The\\nfarther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon\\nunbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any\\nactually igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that\\nsunless sea were hot.\\n\\nAfter a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though\\nthe tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of\\ncarved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that\\ngrooves were cut in the floor.\\n\\nSeveral times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not\\nrecorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the\\nproblem of our return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in\\ncase we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss.\\n\\nThe nameless scent of such things was very distinct. Doubtless it\\nwas suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known\\nconditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain\\npersons than most suspect--indeed, it was just such a lure which had\\nbrought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place.\\n\\nWe saw several penguins as we passed along, and speculated on the\\ndistance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect\\na steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous\\nwanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be\\ndepended on.\\n\\nAfter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly\\naccentuated, and we kept very careful track of the various lateral\\nopenings we passed. There was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but\\nthis was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The\\ntemperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come\\nupon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was\\ncomposed of furs and tent cloths taken from Lake\\'s camp, and we did\\nnot pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been\\nslashed.\\n\\nSlightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size\\nand number of the side galleries, and concluded that the densely\\nhoneycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been\\nreached.\\n\\nThe nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely\\nless offensive odor--of what nature we could not guess, though we\\nthought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrane fungi.\\n\\nThen came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the\\ncarvings had not prepared us--a broadening and rising into a lofty,\\nnatural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five\\nfeet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading\\naway into cryptical darkness.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThough this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both\\ntorches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction\\nof several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were\\nrough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the\\nsolid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all débris,\\ndetritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent.\\n\\nExcept for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of\\nthe floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the\\nsingularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling.\\n\\nThe curious new fetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was\\nexcessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the\\nother. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost\\nglistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than\\nany of the monstrous things we have previously encountered.\\n\\nThe regularity of the passage immediately ahead, prevented all\\nconfusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great\\ncave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail blazing\\nif any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course,\\ncould no longer be expected.\\n\\nUpon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the\\ntunnel walls--and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical\\nchange which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage.\\nWe realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones\\' sculpture\\nat the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior\\nworkmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us.\\n\\nBut now, in this deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden\\ndifference wholly transcending explanation--a difference in basic\\nnature as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and\\ncalamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed\\nrate of decline could have led one to expect it.\\n\\nThis new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in\\ndelicacy of detail. It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands\\nfollowing the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier\\nsections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the\\ngeneral surface.\\n\\nDanforth had the idea that it was a second carving--a sort of\\npalimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design. In\\nnature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and consisted of\\ncrude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical\\ntradition of the Old Ones, yet seeming more like a parody than a\\nperpetuation of that tradition.\\n\\nSince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we\\nresumed our advance after a cursory look.\\n\\nWe saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague\\nsuspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within\\nthe earth. The new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we\\ncould detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent.\\n\\nPuffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in\\ntemperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the\\ngreat abyss. Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on\\nthe polished floor ahead--obstructions which were quite definitely not\\npenguins--and turned on our second torch after making sure that the\\nobjects were quite stationary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  XI.\\n\\n\\nStill another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult\\nto proceed. I ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some\\nexperiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing,\\nand leave only such added sensitiveness that memory re-inspired all the\\noriginal horror.\\n\\nWe saw, as I have said, certain obstructions on the polished\\nfloor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost\\nsimultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange,\\nprevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of\\nthose others which had gone before us.\\n\\nThe light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions\\nwere, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even from\\na distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been\\nthe six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded\\ngraves at poor Lake\\'s camp.\\n\\nThey were, indeed, as lacking in completeness as most of those we\\nhad unearthed--though it grew plain from the thick, dark-green pool\\ngathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely\\ngreater recency. There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake\\'s\\nbulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the\\ngroup which had preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly\\nunexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had\\noccurred down here in the dark.\\n\\nPenguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks; and\\nour ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had\\nthose others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The\\nobstructions did not suggest it, for penguin beaks against the tough\\ntissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage\\nour approaching glance was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge\\nblind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful.\\n\\nHad there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the\\nabsent four responsible? If so, where were they? Were they close at\\nhand and likely to form an immediate menace to us? We glanced anxiously\\nat some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow\\nand frankly reluctant approach.\\n\\nWhatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had\\nfrightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must,\\nthen, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable\\ngulf beyond, since there were no signs that any birds had normally\\ndwelt here.\\n\\nPerhaps, we reflected, there had been a hideous running fight, with\\nthe weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their\\npursuers finished them. One could picture the demonic fray between\\nnamelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with\\ngreat clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.\\n\\nI say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions\\nslowly and reluctantly. Would to Heaven we had never approached them at\\nall, but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with\\nthe greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking\\nthe things they had superseded--run back, before we had seen what we\\ndid see, and before our minds were burned with something which will\\nnever let us breathe easily again!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nBoth of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we\\nsoon realized the dominant factor in their incompleteness. Mauled,\\ncompressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their chief common\\ninjury was total decapitation.\\n\\nFrom each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as\\nwe drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some\\nhellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage.\\n\\nTheir noisome dark-green ichor formed a large, spreading pool; but its\\nstench was half overshadowed by that newer and stranger stench, here\\nmore pungent than at any other point along our route.\\n\\nOnly when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we\\ntrace that second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source--and the\\ninstant we did so Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures\\nof the Old Ones\\' history in the Permian Age one hundred and fifty\\nmillion years ago, gave vent to a nerve-tortured cry which echoed\\nhysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil,\\npalimpsest carvings.\\n\\nI came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those\\nprimal sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the\\nnameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on\\ncertain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones--those whom the frightful\\nShoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly\\nheadlessness in the great war of resubjugation.\\n\\nThey were infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old,\\nbygone things; for Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by\\nhuman beings or portrayed by any beings.\\n\\nThe mad author of the _Necronomicon_ had nervously tried to swear that\\nnone had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers\\nhad ever conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and\\nreflect all forms and organs and processes--viscous agglutinations\\nof bubbling cells--rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic\\nand ductile--slaves of suggestion, builders of cities--more and more\\nsullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and\\nmore imitative! Great Heaven! What madness made even those blasphemous\\nOld Ones willing to use and to carve such things?\\n\\nAnd now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and\\nreflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those\\nheadless bodies and stank obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose\\ncause only a diseased fancy could envisage--clung to those bodies\\nand sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly\\nresculptured wall in a series of grouped dots--we understood the\\nquality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths.\\n\\nIt was not fear of those four missing others--for all too well did we\\nsuspect they would do no harm again. Poor devils! After all, they were\\nnot evil things of their kind. They were the men of another age and\\nanother order of being. Nature had played a hellish jest on them--as\\nit will on any others that human madness, callousness, or cruelty may\\nhereafter drag up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste--and\\nthis was their tragic homecoming.\\n\\nThey had not been even savages--for what indeed had they done? That\\nawful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch--perhaps an attack by\\nthe furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defense against\\nthem and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and\\nparaphernalia! Poor Lake. Poor Gedney. And poor Old Ones! Scientists\\nto the last--what had they done that we would not have done in their\\nplace? Lord, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the\\nincredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things\\nonly a little less incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities,\\nstar spawn--whatever they had been, they were men!\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThey had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once\\nworshiped and roamed among the tree ferns. They had found their dead\\ncity brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as\\nwe had done. They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled\\ndepths of blackness they had never seen--and what had they found?\\n\\nAll this flashed in unison through the thoughts of Danforth and me as\\nwe looked from those headless, slime-coated shapes to the loathsome\\npalimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of fresh slime on\\nthe wall beside them--looked and understood what must have triumphed\\nand survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted,\\npenguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had\\nbegun to belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth\\'s hysterical scream.\\n\\nThe shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had\\nfrozen us into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later\\nconversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our\\nthoughts at that moment.\\n\\nIt seemed æons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been\\nmore than ten or fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled\\nforward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulk--and then\\ncame a sound which upset much of what we had just decided, and in so\\ndoing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking,\\nconfused penguins over our former trail back to the city, along\\nice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that\\narchaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer\\nair and light of day.\\n\\n[Illustration: _And then came a sound--a horrible sound--which enabled\\nus to run like mad for the sane outer air_----]\\n\\nThe new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided;\\nbecause it was what poor Lake\\'s dissection had led us to attribute\\nto those we had just judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me,\\nprecisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that\\nspot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly\\nhad a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around\\nthe lofty mountain caves.\\n\\nAt the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if\\nonly because of the surprising way Danforth\\'s impression chimed with\\nmine. Of course, common reading is what prepared us both to make the\\ninterpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about\\nunsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when\\nwriting his \"Arthur Gordon Pym\" a century ago.\\n\\nIt will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of\\nunknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the\\nantarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic, spectrally snowy\\nbirds of that malign region\\'s core. \"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\" That, I\\nmay admit, is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden\\nsound behind the advancing white mist--that insidious, musical piping\\nover a singularly wide range.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nWe were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been\\nuttered, though we knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable\\nany scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us\\nin a moment if it really wished to do so.\\n\\nWe had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a display\\nof kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of\\ncapture, if only from scientific curiosity.\\n\\nAfter all, if such a one had nothing to fear for itself it would have\\nno motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this juncture, we\\nused our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the mist\\nwas thinning. Would we see at last, a complete and living specimen of\\nthose others? Again came that insidious musical piping--\"_Tekeli-li!\\nTekeli-li!_\"\\n\\nThen, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred\\nto us that the entity might be wounded. We could take no chances,\\nhowever, since it was very obviously approaching in answer to\\nDanforth\\'s scream, rather than in flight from any other entity. The\\ntiming was too close to admit of doubt.\\n\\nOf the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable\\nnightmare--that fetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm\\nwhose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve\\nand squirm through the burrows of the hills--we could form no guess;\\nand it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old\\nOne--perhaps a lone survivor--to the peril of recapture and a nameless\\nfate.\\n\\nThank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened\\nagain, and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying\\npenguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying\\nsigns of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor\\nconfusion when we had passed them.\\n\\nOnce more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping--\"_Tekeli-li!\\nTekeli-li!_\" We had been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had\\nmerely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the\\nhellish slime inscription above them. We could never know what that\\ndemon message was--but those burials at Lake\\'s camp had shown how much\\nimportance the beings attached to their dead.\\n\\nOur recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open\\ncavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving\\nthose morbid palimpsest sculptures--almost felt even when scarcely\\nseen--behind.\\n\\nAnother thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the\\npossibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large\\ngalleries. There were several of the blind albino penguins in the open\\nspace, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was\\nextreme to the point of unaccountability.\\n\\nIf at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of\\ntraveling need, keeping it strictly in front of us, the frightened\\nsquawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our\\nfootfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead.\\n\\nAmidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor\\nof the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other\\nmorbidly polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing\\nfeature; even, so far as we could conjecture, for those indicated\\nspecial senses which made the Old Ones partly, though imperfectly,\\nindependent of light in emergencies.\\n\\nIn fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves\\nin our haste. For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on\\ntoward the dead city; since the consequences of loss in those unknown\\nfoothill honeycombings would be unthinkable.\\n\\nThe fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the\\nthing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on\\nthe right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in\\nconjunction with the mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate\\nkept the curling vapors thick enough at the right moment, for they were\\nconstantly shifting and threatening to vanish.\\n\\nIndeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the\\nnauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually\\ncaught one first and only half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we\\ncast a final, desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the\\ntorch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit. If\\nthe fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us the half\\nglimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semivision\\ncan be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nOur exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the\\nimmemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course\\nof its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a\\nsubconscious question raised by one of our senses.\\n\\nIn the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centered on the\\nproblem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyze\\ndetails; yet even so our latent brain cells must have wondered at the\\nmessage brought them by our nostrils. Afterward, we realized what it\\nwas--that our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless\\nobstructions, and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had\\nnot brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for.\\n\\nIn the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately\\nunexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought\\nto have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with\\nthose others. This it had not done--for instead, the newer and less\\nbearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more\\npoisonously insistent each second.\\n\\nSo we glanced back--simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt\\nthe incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As\\nwe did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily\\nthinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could,\\nor in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the\\nentity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the\\nlabyrinth center ahead.\\n\\nUnhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot\\'s wife, paid much more dearly\\nfor a backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged\\npiping--\"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\"\\n\\nDanforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the\\nrest of the journey was hearing him light-headedly chant a hysterical\\nformula in which I alone of mankind could have found anything but\\ninsane irrelevance. It reverberated in falsetto echoes among the\\nsquawks of the penguins; reverberated through the vaulting ahead,\\nand--thank Heaven--through the now empty vaultings behind. He could not\\nhave begun it at once--else we would not have been alive and blindly\\nracing. I shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his nervous\\nreactions might have brought.\\n\\n\"South Station Under--Washington Under--Park Street\\nUnder--Kendall--Central--Harvard----\" The poor fellow was chanting the\\nfamiliar stations of the Boston-Cambridge tunnel that burrowed through\\nour peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in New England, yet to\\nme the ritual had neither irrelevance nor home feeling. It had only\\nhorror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous, nefandous analogy that\\nhad suggested it.\\n\\nWe had expected, upon looking back, to see a terrible and incredible\\nmoving entity if the mists were thin enough; but of that entity we had\\nformed a clear idea. What we did see--for the mists were indeed all too\\nmalignly thinned--was something altogether different, and immeasurably\\nmore hideous and detestable. It was the utter, objective embodiment of\\nthe fantastic novelist\\'s \\'thing that should not be\\'; and its nearest\\ncomprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees\\nit from a station platform--the great black front looming colossally\\nout of infinite subterraneous distance, constellated with strangely\\ncolored lights and filling the prodigious burrow.\\n\\nBut we were not on a station platform. We were on the track ahead as\\nthe nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly\\nonward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and\\ndriving before it a spiral, rethickening cloud of the pallid abyss\\nvapor.\\n\\nIt was a terrible, indescribable thing, vaster than any subway train--a\\nshapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and\\nwith myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of\\ngreenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon\\nus, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening\\nfloor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.\\n\\nStill came that eldritch, mocking cry--\"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\" And at\\nlast we remembered that the demonic Shoggoths--given life, though, and\\nplastic organ patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language\\nsave that which the dot groups expressed--had likewise no voice save\\nthe imitated accents of their bygone masters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 XII.\\n\\n\\nDanforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured\\nhemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms\\nand corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream fragments\\ninvolving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion.\\n\\nThere was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those\\nburied epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot\\ncylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous\\nprocession of heroic sculptures in the dead race\\'s early and undecayed\\ntechnique--a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years\\nago.\\n\\nFinally, scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound\\nof tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising\\nwestward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond\\nthe more crumbled structures toward the east.\\n\\nThe sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice vapors,\\nand the cold clutched at our vitals.\\n\\nIn less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the\\nfoothills--the probable ancient terrace--by which we had descended, and\\ncould see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on\\nthe rising slope ahead.\\n\\nHalfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing\\nspell, and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible\\nstone shapes below us--once more outlined mystically against an unknown\\nwest. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning\\nhaziness; the restless ice vapors having moved up to the zenith, where\\ntheir mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some\\nbizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nThere now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind\\nthe grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose\\nneedle-pointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose\\ncolor of the western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the\\nancient table-land, the depressed course of the bygone river traversing\\nit as an irregular ribbon of shadow.\\n\\nFor a second we gasped in admiration of the scene\\'s unearthly cosmic\\nbeauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this\\nfar violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of\\nthe forbidden land--highest of earth\\'s peaks and focus of earth\\'s evil;\\nharborers of nameless horrors and Archæan secrets; shunned and prayed\\nto by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living\\nthing of earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending\\nstrange beams across the plains in the polar night.\\n\\nIf the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told\\ntruly, these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three\\nhundred miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin\\nessence jut above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of\\na monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens.\\n\\nLooking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of\\nwhat the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their\\naccursed sloping--and wondered how much sense and how much folly had\\nlain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently.\\n\\nI recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen\\nMary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson\\'s expedition\\nwas doubtless working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that\\nno evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a glimpse of what\\nmight lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a\\nmeasure of my overwrought condition at the time--and Danforth seemed to\\nbe even worse.\\n\\nYet before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our\\nplane our fears had become transferred to the lesser, but vast enough,\\nrange whose re-crossing lay ahead of us.\\n\\nFrom these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly\\nand hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange\\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the\\ndamnable honeycombings inside them, and of the frightful amorphous\\nentities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming sway even to\\nthe topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the\\nprospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where\\nthe wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around\\nseveral of the summits--as poor Lake must have done when he made that\\nearly mistake about volcanism--and thought shiveringly of that kindred\\nmist from which we had just escaped--of that, and of the blasphemous,\\nhorror-fostering abyss whence all such vapors came.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAll was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying\\nfurs. Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a\\nvery smooth take-off over the nightmare city.\\n\\nAt a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since the\\nice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things;\\nbut at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed for the pass, we\\nfound navigation quite practicable.\\n\\nAs we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind\\'s strange piping again\\nbecame manifest, and I could see Danforth\\'s hands trembling at the\\ncontrols. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment that I\\nmight be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing\\nbetween pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take\\nover his duties he did not protest.\\n\\nI tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared\\nat the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass.\\n\\nBut Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous\\nnervous pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling\\nabout as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the\\ncave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy,\\nrampart-strown foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely\\nclouded sky.\\n\\nIt was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass,\\nthat his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster, by shattering\\nmy tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the\\ncontrols for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and\\nwe made the crossing safely----Yet I am afraid that Danforth will never\\nbe the same again.\\n\\nI have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him\\nscream out so insanely--a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly\\nresponsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted\\nconversation above the wind\\'s piping and the engine\\'s buzzing as we\\nreached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the\\ncamp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made\\nas we prepared to leave the nightmare city.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAll that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a\\nmirage. It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes\\nand caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily honeycombed mountains\\nof madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demonic glimpse,\\namong the churning westward zenith clouds, of what lay back of those\\nother violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and\\nfeared.\\n\\nHe has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things\\nabout \"the black pit,\" \"the carven rim,\" \"the proto-Shoggoths,\" \"the\\nwindowless solids with five dimensions,\" \"the nameless cylinders,\" \"the\\nelder pharos,\" \"Yog-Sothoth,\" \"the primal white jelly,\" \"the color out\\nof space,\" \"the wings,\" \"the eyes in darkness,\" \"the moon-ladder,\" \"the\\noriginal, the eternal, the undying,\" and other bizarre conceptions;\\nbut when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it\\nto his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed,\\nis known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through\\nthat worm-riddled copy of the _Necronomicon_ kept under lock and key in\\nthe college library.\\n\\nThe higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and\\ndisturbed enough; and although I did not see the zenith I can well\\nimagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms.\\nImagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be\\nreflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud,\\nmight easily have supplied the rest--and, of course, Danforth did not\\nhint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a\\nchance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never have seen so much\\nin one instantaneous glance.\\n\\nAt the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single,\\nmad word of all too obvious source: \"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\"\\n\\n\\n                                THE END\\n\\n\\n        \\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS ***\\n        \\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n']}"
